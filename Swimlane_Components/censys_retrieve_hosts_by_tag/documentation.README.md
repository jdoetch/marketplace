# Censys - Retrieve Hosts for a Tag

## Overview
The Censys - Retrieve Hosts for a Tag component is a sophisticated automation tool designed to interact with Censys APIs to efficiently retrieve detailed host information based on specific tags. This component enables security analysts and network administrators to streamline their asset management and enhance their security posture by leveraging tag-based searches within the Censys data set.

## Summary of the Component
This component initiates by triggering the `Create Error Enrichment` action, which is designed as a transformation type action within the automation workflow. The action processes input errors and enriches them with additional contextual data necessary for meaningful insights.

### Actions
1. **Create Error Enrichment**
   - **Type:** Transformation
   - **Description:** Processes error data to add contextual information.
   - **On Success:** Proceeds to the next step as defined in the workflow.
   - **On Failure:** Handles errors accordingly and logs them.
   - **On Complete:** Finalizes the enrichment process and outputs the result.
   - **Transformations Involved:**
     - **Error Enrichment**
       - **Description:** Enhances error data with additional details like provider, status, and timestamps.
       - **Inputs:** Includes data such as error provider, error status, and error result.
       - **Output:** Rich error data structured for further use in the workflow.

### Process Flow Summary
The Censys - Retrieve Hosts for a Tag component operates in the following sequence:
1. **Start:** Triggered manually or by a predefined condition in the network.
2. **Error Enrichment:** Perform data transformation to enrich error information.
3. **Decision Point:** Depending on the success or failure of the enrichment,
   - **Success Path:** Continue to additional actions (if defined).
   - **Failure Path:** Trigger error handling routines.
4. **Completion:** Outputs the enriched data and terminates or loops back based on the configuration.

This component is crucial for maintaining a refined and automated monitoring environment, helping teams to swiftly categorize and respond to issues based on enriched error information and structured tagging within Censys.
