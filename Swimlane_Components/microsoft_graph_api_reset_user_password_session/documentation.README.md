# Microsoft GraphAPI - Reset User Password & Session

## Overview
The "Microsoft GraphAPI - Reset User Password & Session" component is designed to automate the process of resetting user passwords and revoking all sessions via the Microsoft Graph API. This component addresses the need for efficient security protocols within an organization, enhancing response times and minimizing potential breaches by resetting user credentials and sessions quickly and effectively.

## Component Summary
The component consists of three main actions that manage the state and execution of the password reset and session revocation operations. The actions are designed to interact seamlessly to ensure a successful operation, with pathways defined for both successful and unsuccessful outcomes.

### Component Actions
1. **Create Status Variable**
   - **Type:** createVariables
   - **Purpose:** Initializes status variables to monitor the reset processes.
   - **On-Success:** Executes a parallel group that handles the reset operations simultaneously.
   - **On-Failure:** No subsequent action is specified on failure.

2. **Parallel Execution Group (parallel_ao7v4)**
   - **Type:** parallelGroup
   - **Purpose:** Manages two critical operations concurrently:
     - *Revoke All Sessions*: Revokes all active sessions for the user.
     - *Reset Password*: Resets the userâ€™s password.
   - **On-Success:** Triggers an update to status variables, reflecting the results of the operations.

3. **Update Status Variables**
   - **Type:** updateVariables
   - **Purpose:** Updates the status variables with the outcome of the reset and revoke operations.
   - **On-Complete:** Concludes the workflow without any further action.

## Process Flow Summary
The component begins the process by creating necessary status variables. Upon successful creation, it concurrently revokes all user sessions and resets the user password. Depending on the results of these actions, status variables are updated to reflect the operation's success or failure, thereby concluding the workflow.

This flow ensures a robust mechanism to handle potential security issues promptly, leveraging the powerful capabilities of Microsoft Graph API.
