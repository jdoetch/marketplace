# MS Graph - Get Identity Directory Device Component Documentation

## Overview

This document details the technical aspects of the MS Graph - Get Identity Directory Device component. This component is designed to interact with Microsoft Graph API to retrieve information about directory devices. It processes actions within a defined scheme to ensure the retrieval of necessary data and handling of potential errors. 

## Summary of the Component

The MS Graph - Get Identity Directory Device component is built to integrate with Microsoft Graph API. It uses specific API endpoints to fetch details about directory devices. This component employs a sequence of actions to manage responses and errors effectively, guiding the flow from initiation to completion.

## Actions Description

The component consists of several actions, including:
1. **Success** - Type: Python
    - **Purpose**: To handle the successfully retrieved data.
    - **On-Success**: -
    - **On-Failure**: -
    - **On-Complete**: - 

2. **Get Identity Directory Device** - Type: Connector
    - **Purpose**: To fetch data from Microsoft Graph concerning identity directory devices.
    - **On-Success**: Move to Success action.
    - **On-Failure**: Moves to Failure action.
    - **On-Complete**: -
    - **Inputs**: 
        - **Path Parameters**: ID retrieved from $inputs.device_id
    - **Environment**:
    - **Asset**: Configured with specifics to connect and authenticate requests sent to Microsoft Graph API.

3. **Failure** - Type: Python
    - **Purpose**: To handle and process any errors encountered while attempting to fetch data.
    - **On-Success**: -
    - **On-Failure**: -
    - **On-Complete**: -

## Detailed Flow Process

On initiation, the component begins by attempting to fetch device details using the Microsoft Graph API (Get Identity Directory Device Action). Depending on the outcome, it is routed to:
- **Success**
    - The output is processed and tagged successfully retrieved.
- **Failure**
    - Errors are processed, and failure is recorded.

On completion of the action, respective outputs or errors are captured to finalize the process run.

## Overall Process Flow Summary

The overall process flow of this component is straightforward:
- Initiate data fetch using the Microsoft Graph API.
- Based on API interaction outcome, route to success or failure actions.
- Process the retrieved data or errors.
- Complete the operation with final state handling.
