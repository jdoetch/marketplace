# Technical Documentation for Maltiverse - Lookup Host

## Overview
The Maltiverse - Lookup Host component is designed to provide automated threat intelligence and domain reputation services. This component assists in the dynamic assessment of host names within an IT infrastructure, facilitating automated security processes driven by actionable intelligence.

## Summary of the Component
**Maltiverse - Lookup Host** aims at enriching the security mechanisms of an organization by providing detailed insights about the reputation and other related metadata of a host. This allows security teams to make informed decisions based on the threat landscape associated with the host domains they investigate.

### Action Details
- **Action Name:** Enrichment - Create Error
  - **Type:** Transformation
  - **Description:** Generates enriched error data based on inputs regarding the host's reputation, timestamp, and related error details.
  - **On-Success:** Further actions might be triggered depending on the designed workflow.
  - **On-Failure:** Logs or other failure handling strategies are activated.
  - **On-Complete:** Completes the action sequence and hands over to any subsequent steps defined in the workflow.

### Inputs
- **Error Provider:** The source providing the error.
- **Error Status:** The status message or code indicating the type of error.
- **Error Result:** The actual content or data of the error.

### Transformations
- **Transformation Name:** TEDS Error Enrichment
  - **Description:** Processes the input errors to add enrichment layers such as reputational data.
  - **Inputs:**
    - Enrichment Type: Reputation
    - Enrichment Provider: The service providing the reputation data.
    - Enrichment Verdict: The outcome or the nature of the reputation analysis.
    - Enrichment Timestamp: The exact time of the enrichment process.
    - Enrichment Permalink: A stable link to the generated enrichment data.
    - Enrichment Content: Detailed description derived from the input error data.

## Overall Process Flow Summary
This component initiates with the reception of error inputs that relate to a host's domain. These inputs are then transformed into a structured format that includes significant reputational data to assess the potential threats or trust level of the host. The successful execution of this action enriches the initial data, facilitating a well-informed decision-making process about the security measures to be applied to the host or its related activities. In case of failure, the process ensures that there are adequate logs for review.

By assessing host reputations in real-time and automating threat intelligence, the Maltiverse - Lookup Host component plays a key role in maintaining robust cybersecurity postures within enterprises.
