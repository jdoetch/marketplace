# Technical Documentation: ServiceNow - Create Incident

## Overview
The "ServiceNow - Create Incident" component is designed to automate the incident creation process within the ServiceNow platform. This automation component assists organizations in efficiently managing their IT service management processes by allowing system or application events to trigger incident reports directly in ServiceNow.

## Component Summary
This component acts as an integral connector between monitoring systems and ServiceNow, ensuring that incidents are reported and managed promptly without manual data entry. It leverages predefined input schemas to capture relevant event data, which it then uses to create incidents in ServiceNow.

## Actions and Process Flow
### Action: Create Incident
- **Type:** ServiceNow API Integration
- **Purpose:** To create an incident ticket in ServiceNow based on triggered alerts from applications or monitoring systems.
- **On-Success:** Confirmation of incident creation with incident ID.
- **On-Failure:** Error logging and notification for manual intervention.

### Inputs Required
- **Alert Categories**: Specify the category of the alert.
- **Alert Description**: Details about the alert.
- **Alert Severity**: Severity level of the alert which influences the priority of the incident.

### Subsequent Steps
1. **Data Validation**: Validates the incoming data against the predefined schema.
2. **API Interaction**: Engages with ServiceNow's API to create an incident.
3. **Response Handling**: Captures and logs the response from ServiceNow, which includes the incident ID on successful creation.

### Error Handling
- In cases where the API call fails, the system logs the error and sends a notification to the designated system administrator or incident handler.

## Overall Process Flow Summary
1. **Trigger**: Component gets activated by an incoming alert.
2. **Data Extraction**: Parses and validates incoming data based on component's input schema.
3. **Incident Creation**: Makes an API call to ServiceNow with the required data fields.
4. **Response Processing**: Handles the API response, logs incident ID, or error.
5. **Completion**: On successful creation, proceeds to close the loop, or on failure, triggers error handling procedures.

This flow ensures that incidents are promptly and accurately reported in ServiceNow, leading to faster resolution times and improved IT service management.
