# API Void - Check Site Trustworthiness

## Overview
The API Void - Check Site Trustworthiness component is designed to evaluate the trustworthiness and reputation of websites by interacting with external API services. This document provides an in-depth technical guide on how the component functions, the sequence of operations it performs, and its integration with other automated processes.

### Purpose of This Flow
The need for this flow stems from the imperative to safeguard networks and data from malicious websites. By automatically assessing sites through this component, users can preemptively block or flag sites with poor reputation scores, effectively reducing the risk of cyber threats.

## Summary of The Component
API Void - Check Site Trustworthiness automates the process of sending a site's URL to the API Void service and receiving trustworthiness reports. This component includes multiple actions like creating variables, updating enrichment data, normalizing data, and making HTTP requests to the API provider.

### Actions and Workflows

#### 1. Create Variables
- **Type:** CreateVariables
- **Purpose:** Initiate the component by setting up necessary variables.
- **On-Success:** Proceed to the HTTP request stage.
- **On-Failure:** Terminate or log the error.
  
#### 2. HTTP Request
- **Type:** HTTP
- **Purpose:** Connects to the API Void to submit the site URL and fetch the trustworthiness report.
- **On-Success:** Passes fetched data to create enrichments.
- **On-Failure:** Normalize creation errors.

#### 3. Create Enrichment
- **Type:** Transformation
- **Purpose:** Transform API response data into a structured format for further use.
- **On-Success:** Pass data to update enrichment action.
- **On-Failure:** Handle and log transformation errors.

#### 4. Update Enrichment
- **Type:** UpdateVariables
- **Purpose:** Updates the enrichment data based on the initial transformation and subsequent processing logic.
- **Complete Process:** End or hand over to a different process component.

#### 5. Normalize Creation Error
- **Type:** Connector
- **Purpose:** Normalizes error data from the API interaction to standardize error handling.
- **On-Success:** Retry the request or notify for manual intervention.
  
## Process Flow
The process begins with the creation of initial variables followed by triggering an HTTP request to the API Void service. Depending on the HTTP request's success, the process either moves forward to data enrichment stages or handles errors via the normalization process. Successful inquiries lead to data transformations, subsequently updating the system with new enrichments. Finally, any errors across the stages are normalized for consistent error management.

#### Standard Operating Procedures
- **Initialization:** Confirm API access credentials and endpoint availability.
- **Execution:** Monitor component performance and incident logs.
- **Failover:** Ensure alternates for error conditions and API downtimes.
- **Security:** Treat all incoming data as potentially harmful and validate accordingly.
