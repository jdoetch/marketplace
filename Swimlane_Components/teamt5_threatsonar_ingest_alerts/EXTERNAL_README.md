Swimlane Turbine components are standardized and modular automation building blocks that can be used and reused across all of your applicable automation use cases.

This TeamT5 ThreatSonar - Ingest Alerts component automatically ingests incoming TeamT5 ThreatSonar Alerts and converts the alert data into Turbine Extendable Data Schema(TEDS) for analysis, enrichment and response purpose. This common data model allows security practitioners to standardize data across many security tools for common security events, enrichments and remediations in Swimlane's Turbine platform.

This component empowers security teams with automated threat intelligence ingestion and endpoint management, streamlining incident response and enhancing organizational security.
