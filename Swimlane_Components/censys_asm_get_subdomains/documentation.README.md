# Censys ASM - Get SubDomains Component Documentation

## Overview
The "Censys ASM - Get SubDomains" component is designed for automation within security environments, providing capabilities for retrieving subdomains associated with a given domain. This component is essential for cybersecurity professionals and IT teams to gain insights into domain structures, potentially uncovering subdomains that could be points of vulnerability or interest.

## Purpose
This component aims to leverage the Censys ASM's robust data gathering capabilities to facilitate the identification and analysis of subdomains across various networks, enhancing domain management and security measures efficiently.

## Process Flow Summary
The component executes a structured flow of actions, starting from data retrieval followed by processing and conditional response handling based on the action outcomes. Hereâ€™s a detailed process flow:

1. **Initiate Data Retrieval**: The process begins with the "Create Error Enrichment" action, which is intended as a transformation function.
   
2. **Transformation Action**:
   - **Type**: Transformation
   - **Description**: Focuses on enriching error-related data, facilitating a deeper analysis.
   - **On-Success**: Proceeds to the next step.
   - **On-Failure**: Ceases further action and logs the error.

3. **Data Processing**:
   - **Sub-Actions**:
     - **Error Enrichment**: Refines the error data by categorizing and labeling for better clarity and response strategy.
     - **Inputs**:
       - **Enrichment Type**: Reputation or other specified types.
       - **Provider and Result**: Detailed insights based on the error encountered.

4. **Decision Points**:
   - Actions are decided based on the outputs from the previous steps.
   - Either moves forward in the workflow or stops, depending on success or failure states.

5. **Completion**:
   - **On-Completion**: Finalizes the data enrichment, ensuring that all necessary transformations are properly applied.
   - **Publish and Post**: Distribute the enriched data to required endpoints or systems for further use or store it accordingly.

## Environment and Configuration
- **Namespace**: Default
- **Entrypoints**: Create Error Enrichment
- **Timeout Settings**: Configured as per the operational guidelines to ensure timely processing.

## Benefits
- **Automated Subdomain Discovery**: Automates the process of discovering subdomains, saving time and reducing manual errors.
- **Security Posture Enhancement**: Helps in identifying potentially malicious subdomains, thereby enhancing the overall security posture.
- **Scalability**: Supports scaling across multiple domains or networks with ease.
