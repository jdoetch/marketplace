# ThreatQuotient - Enrich Observable Component Documentation

## Overview
The "ThreatQuotient - Enrich Observable" component is designed to enhance the data surrounding observable elements in security processes by utilizing a series of actions. This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of each action and their interactions to help users understand and effectively implement the component.

## Component Summary
The component leverages various actions to process observables, verify their type, and enrich them with metadata that can be used for more informed decision-making in security operations.

### Key Actions

#### Handle Files
- **Type:** Parallel Group
- **Purpose:** Manages the execution flow of multiple file handling actions concurrently to optimize performance.
- **Steps Involved:**
  - On Success: Move to consequent actions based on conditions.
  - On Failure: Defined actions are executed to handle exceptions or errors.
  - On Complete: Certain cleanup or final steps are undertaken.

#### Build File from Observable Metadata
- **Type:** Connector
- **Purpose:** Constructs a file from provided observable metadata which is crucial for subsequent analysis or operations.
- **Steps Involved:**
  - On Success: Triggers the Get SHA action to proceed with obtaining a cryptographic hash for the file.
  - On Failure: Error handling actions are taken.
  - Inputs: Utilizes the metadata of an observable to create a file.

#### Get SHA
- **Type:** Transformation
- **Purpose:** Calculates the SHA hash value of a file to ensure data integrity and provide a checksum for validation.
- **Steps Involved:**
  - On Success: Executes an action to update the observable value with the calculated SHA hash.
  - Outputs: Returns the SHA value which is used as a vital data point in security assessments.

#### Update Observable Value with SHA
- **Type:** Update Variables
- **Purpose:** Updates the observable's value with the SHA hash to maintain the integrity and traceability of data.
- **Steps Involved:**
  - On Success: Typically, this would end the action sequence or trigger further specified processes depending on the setup.

### Process Flow Summary
1. Observable metadata is examined and, if deemed necessary, used to build a file.
2. This file undergoes a SHA hash transformation to secure and validate its data.
3. The SHA value is then used to update the observable's value, ensuring that the data remains consistent and traceable throughout the system.
4. Depending on outcomes at each action, there are provisions for error handling and condition-based redirection to other actions.

This component encapsulates key operations necessary in the enrichment of observables in cybersecurity efforts, providing tools for better management and utilization of data in security environments.
