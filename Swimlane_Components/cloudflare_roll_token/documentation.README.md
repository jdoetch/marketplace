# Cloudflare - Roll Token Component Documentation

## Overview
The Cloudflare - Roll Token component is designed to provide automated management of security tokens through the Cloudflare API. This component is essential for maintaining robust security practices by automating the token lifecycle, particularly the rolling process which is critical for ensuring token integrity and security.

## Summary of the Component
The Cloudflare - Roll Token component executes an HTTP action to roll a specified token within the Cloudflare environment. Upon successful execution, it can trigger subsequent actions or handle failures accordingly.


## Actions Detail
### Roll Token Action
- **Type:** HTTP
- **Description:** This action rolls the specified token to ensure security credentials remain secure and are rotated frequently.
- **Inputs:**
  - **Endpoint:** `https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/tokens/{token_id}/value`
  - **Method:** HTTP Method not explicitly specified; assume GET or POST as typical methods for REST APIs.
  - **Headers:**
    - **Auth-Mail:** Enter authentication email.
    - **Auth-Key:** Enter authentication key.
  - **Settings:**
    - **Follow Redirects:** `true`
    - **Verify Certificates:** `true`
  - **Body:** `{"contentType":"application/json", "data":"{}"}`
- **Output Schema Reference:** Identified by `cfed---ed-decb`
- **On-Success:** Proceeds to any defined subsequent steps specific to success scenarios.
- **On-Failure:** Engages defined steps to handle any error conditions.
- **On-Complete:** General clean-up or logging actions to finalize the process.

## Process Flow
1. **Initiation:** The process starts with a user or automated trigger specifying the need to roll a token.
2. **Execution:** The Roll Token action is executed, contacting the Cloudflare API with specified credentials and target token details.
3. **Response Handling:**
   - **Success:** If the API returns a success response, subsequent success actions are initiated.
   - **Failure:** In case of an error response from the API, the failure steps are activated.
4. **Completion:** The action either completes successfully or with errors, with appropriate handling as specified.

## Conclusion
The Cloudflare - Roll Token component automates the process of rotating security tokens, which is crucial for maintaining a secure and reliable IT infrastructure in systems that interact with Cloudflare services.
