# Censys ASM - Get Seeds Component Documentation

## Overview
The "Censys ASM - Get Seeds" component is designed to automate and streamline the process of gathering seed data for asset management within the Censys Attack Surface Management (ASM) platform. This component integrates into broader security and IT systems to enhance visibility and control over digital assets.

## Summary of the Component
The "Censys ASM - Get Seeds" component operates by executing tasks focused on data enrichment and error handling. It has a primary action of error enrichment that transforms input data based on incoming error statuses and results, ultimately providing detailed insights into error sources and their characteristics.

## Detailed Description of Actions
### Error Enrichment Action
- **Type:** Transformation
- **Purpose:** To create an enriched error dataset from raw input errors, providing a deeper understanding of error types, statuses, and results.
- **Steps:**
  - **On-Success:** Proceed to the subsequent action or end the sequence if no actions are defined.
  - **On-Failure:** Retry the action, log the failure, or halt the sequence based on predefined criteria.
  - **On-Complete:** Publish the results to a specified target or system, ensuring accessibility for further processes or review.

### Enrichment Transformation
- **Title:** Error Enrichment
- **Input:** Takes error-related data, including provider, status, and result.
- **Operation:** Transforms the error data into a structured format that includes the error's type, verdict, timestamp, permalink, content, and raw data.
- **Output:** Generates a detailed error enrichment record highlighting key aspects of errors encountered during operations.

## Process Flow Summary
1. **Initialization:** The component is triggered by an error event or scheduled task.
2. **Error Enrichment:** Inputs are processed to extract and transform error data.
3. **Data Compilation:** Enriched data is compiled into a comprehensive report.
4. **Publication and Distribution:** The enriched error report is published to designated systems or stakeholders.
5. **Completion:** The process concludes, with system logs updated to reflect the action outcomes.

The robust design of this component ensures that error handling is both efficient and informative, aiding in better management of digital assets in a complex technological landscape.
