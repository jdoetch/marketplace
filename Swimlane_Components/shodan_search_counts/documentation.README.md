# Shodan - Search Counts Component Documentation

## Overview
"Shodan - Search Counts" is a component designed to interact with Shodan, a search engine for Internet-connected devices. This component facilitates querying Shodan to count the number of results based on specified search parameters. By using this component, users are able to efficiently gather data counts to help in cybersecurity and network management tasks.

## Summary of the Component
The component includes actions such as "Create Variables", "Update Enrichment", "Create Enrichment", and "Normalize Error", as well as the primary action "Shodan - Search Counts".

### Action Descriptions:
1. **Create Variables**
   - **Type:** Create Variables
   - **Purpose:** Initializes variables for use in subsequent actions.
   - **On Success:** Triggers the "Shodan - Search Counts" action.
   - **Inputs:** Results data packaged for further processing.

2. **Shodan - Search Counts**
   - **Type:** Connector
   - **Purpose:** Queries Shodan's API to get a count of results based on provided search criteria.
   - **On Success:** Proceeds to "Create Enrichment".
   - **On Failure:** Invokes "Normalize Error".
   - **Inputs:** Search criteria including query parameters and facets.

3. **Create Enrichment**
   - **Type:** Transformation
   - **Purpose:** Transforms the data received from Shodan, constructing an enriched format suitable for further processing.
   - **On Success:** Calls "Update Enrichment".
   - **Inputs:** Data from "Shodan - Search Counts", structured into a new format.

4. **Normalize Error**
   - **Type:** Connector
   - **Purpose:** Manages errors from the "Shodan - Search Counts" by standardizing error messages and logging details.
   - **On Success:** Proceeds to "Update Enrichment" for correcting data paths.
   
5. **Update Enrichment**
   - **Type:** Update Variables
   - **Purpose:** Updates variables and prepares the enriched data for final publishing.
   - **Inputs:** Reference to results of "Normalize Error" and/or "Create Enrichment".

### Overall Process
- The component initiates by creating necessary variables.
- It then queries the Shodan API through "Shodan - Search Counts".
- Based on the query response, either proceeds to enrich and format data or to normalize any errors encountered.
- The updated or corrected data is then prepared for final use or publishing.

## Process Flow Summary
The component orchestrates a flow from initialization of variables to handling responses from Shodan. Error handling is seamlessly integrated to ensure data consistency and reliability. The outcome is a structured and enriched output ready for integration into broader security practices or IT management systems.
