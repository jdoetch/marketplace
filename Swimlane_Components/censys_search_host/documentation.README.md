This component leverages the powerful Censys database to provide comprehensive insights into hosts.

### Action: Enrichment - Create Error
- **Type**: Transformation
- **Description**: Facilitates the generation of error-related enrichment data.
- **Steps**:
  1. **On-Success**: Proceed with further transformation.
  2. **On-Failure**: Halt the process and log error details.
  3. **On-Complete**: Conclude the action and update the status.
- **Purpose**: To capture and enrich error data which can be utilized for troubleshooting and improving security postures.

### Inputs:
- **Error Provider**: Source identifier of the error.
- **Error Result**: Specific results or data about the error.
- **Error Status**: Status identifier for the error.

### Transformation: Error Enrichment
- **Title**: Error Enrichment
- **Purpose**: Transform raw error data into a structured format for better analysis.
- **Description**: Accepts raw inputs such as error provider, status, and results. These are then formatted to create a comprehensive view of errors associated with host searches.

### Process Flow:
1. **Begin**: Initiation of the Enrichment - Create Error.
2. **Data Processing**: Transformation through the Error Enrichment process.
3. **Result Handling**:
   - If successful, enriched data is published for further usage.
   - If failure occurs, capture the failure and halt the processing.

## Overall Process Summary
The "Censys - Search Host" component begins with an action aimed at enriching error data. Upon successfully enriching the error data, the process forwards the structured information for either further processing or immediate consumption. In case of failure, the component halts any further actions and captures the related error details, thereby ensuring robust error handling and minimal impact on the system's integrity.
