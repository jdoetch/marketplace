# Microsoft OneDrive - Create Group Upload Session Component Documentation

## Overview
The Microsoft OneDrive - Create Group Upload Session Component is designed to streamline the process of uploading large files in a group environment to Microsoft OneDrive. This component facilitates the creation of upload sessions, allowing multiple users to contribute parts of a file asynchronously, enhancing collaboration and efficiency in shared workspace environments.

## Component Summary
The component leverages automated processes to manage file uploads through the creation of dedicated upload sessions. This ensures high availability and reliability while dealing with large files or high-volume data transfers within corporate settings.

- **Action**: Create Error Enrichment
  - **Type**: Transformation
  - **Purpose**: This action is responsible for handling errors that may occur during the upload session. It enriches error data with additional context, making troubleshooting more effective.
  - **On-Success**: Proceeds with the next steps if the action completes without any issues.
  - **On-Failure**: Triggers specified failure handling actions or notifications.
  - **On-Complete**: Culmination of processes after action completion, regardless of success or failure.
  - **Publish**: Publicly exposes outcomes of the enrichment process.

## Process Flow Summary
1. **Error Handling Initialization**: At the start of the upload session, the error handling mechanisms are set up.
2. **Create Error Enrichment**:
   - **Inputs**:
     - Error provider identification
     - Error result data
     - Error status
   - **Outputs**:
     - Enriched error data with timestamp, provider data, and other contextual information.
3. **Validation and Response**:
   - Actions are validated through predefined checks ensuring all inputs meet the required criteria before proceeding.
   - Depending on the action success or failure, appropriate response mechanisms are activated, either progressing the flow or initiating error management protocols.
4. **Completion**:
   - Once all actions are completed, whether through successful execution or after handling failures, the component ensures that all responses are gathered and finalized for session closure.

By automating these processes, Microsoft OneDrive - Create Group Upload Session Component enhances the resilience and efficiency of file management operations in collaborative environments.
