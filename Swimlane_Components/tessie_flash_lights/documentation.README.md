# Tesla_Flash_Lights Component Documentation

## Overview

The component "Tesla_Flash_Lights" orchestrates actions to control the lighting system of Tesla vehicles. This technical documentation aims to assist users in understanding the component's functionalities, usage, and flow.

## Summary of the Component

The Tesla_Flash_Lights component is designed to interact with Tesla's vehicle APIs to execute light flashing commands. The primary objective is to facilitate remote operations, enhance security measures, and provide a means of non-verbal communication or signal in various scenarios.

## Actions Description

### 1. essie_flash_lights
- **Type**: HTTP
- **Purpose**: Sends a command to the Tesla API to flash the vehicle's lights. Specifically tailored to work with Tesla's remote command features.
- **Input**: Utilizes the vehicle identification number (VIN) to target a specific vehicle.

### 2. set_output
- **Type**: Transformation
- **Purpose**: Handles the output from the tessie_flash_lights` action and prepares it for any necessary publishing or additional processing.
- **On-Success**: Information regarding the action output can be stored or passed to other systems as needed.

## Process Flow Summary

1. **Initiation**:
   - An endpoint from the Tesla API is called using the HTTP method with the vehicleâ€™s VIN to flash the lights.

2. **Action Execution**:
   - `essie_flash_lights`: Sends a command to Tesla's API.
   - Upon successful execution, triggers the `set_output` action.

3. **Result Handling**:
   - `set_output`: Captures and processes the result of the flash lights command. Depending on the outcome, it may handle success or failure differently.

4. **Completion**:
   - The results are made available for further use or logging.
   - The component execution ends after the `set_output` processing.

This component offers robust interaction with Tesla vehicle systems, emphasizing flexible integration with external systems and high configurability.
