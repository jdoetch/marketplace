# Criminal IP - Search Banners

## Overview
This document provides technical documentation for the "Criminal IP - Search Banners" component which is designed to facilitate automated security analysis and operations. The primary objective is to analyze network banners with potential criminal activities by assessing various sources, ensuring a robust defensive mechanism against cyber threats.

## Summary of the Component
"Criminal IP - Search Banners" is a component that aims to streamline the identification and assessment process of potentially malicious IP addresses. By integrating with diverse data sources, it fetches and analyzes network banners, which can be instrumental in pinpointing fraudulent or criminal activities.

## Action Details
### Action: Error Enrichment
- **Type:** Transformation
- **Purpose:** Enriches data obtained from error logs by linking them to the knowledge database for improved understanding and categorization of errors.
- **Description:** Utilizes inputs from error handlers to provide an enriched context about the errors encountered during data processing or system operations.

#### Subsequent Steps
- **On-Success:** Continue with predefined transformations based on successful error enrichment.
- **On-Failure:** Trigger alerts or logs to notify system administrators of the failure to process data correctly.
- **On-Complete:** Ensure that all process-related logs and data points are updated to reflect the outcome of the error enrichment action.

### Transformations
- **Entity:** Error Enrichment Data
  - **Inputs:** error_provider, error_status, error_result
  - **Handling:** Analyzes error data to provide insights into error reasons and the potential impact on system operations.

## Overall Process Flow Summary
1. Start with gathering error data.
2. Perform error enrichment to extract detailed information about each error.
3. On successful completion, further transformations or data handling routines continue.
4. In case of enrichment failures, send notifications and log the incident.
5. Update system or operation logs with the comprehensive results from the enrichment process.

This sequence ensures a meticulous approach towards error management and operational insights, promoting a better-secured environment.
