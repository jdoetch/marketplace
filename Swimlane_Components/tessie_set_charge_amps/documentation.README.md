# Tesla_Set_Charge_Amps Component Documentation

## Overview
The Tesla_Set_Charge_Amps component is designed for automating the process of setting the charging amperage for Tesla vehicles through a secure and efficient API integration. This component ensures that Tesla vehicle owners or service providers can dynamically adjust the charging parameters based on specific needs, resulting in optimized charging schedules and enhanced battery life management.

## Summary of the Component
The Tesla_Set_Charge_Amps component operates through a series of actions that initiate HTTP requests to the Tesla API, handle responses, and finally set the desired output based on the API's response. The component is structured to handle success and failure scenarios to ensure robust operations across different network environments and usage scenarios.

### Actions Description
**1. Tessie_Set_Charge_Amps**
   - **Type:** HTTP
   - **Purpose:** Sends a request to the Tesla API to set the charge amps.
   - **On-Success:** Proceeds to the Set_Output action.

**2. Set_Output**
   - **Type:** Transformation
   - **Purpose:** Transforms the response from the API call into a usable format and sets it as the output of the component.


## Technical Specification

- **Endpoint Configuration:** The API utilizes secure HTTPS protocols with dynamic endpoint configurations that require VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) and desired amperage levels as input.

- **Security Measures:** All communications with the Tesla API are conducted over verified connections with certificate validation, ensuring data integrity and security.

This component is critical for automating the management of electric vehicle charging settings, particularly for Tesla models, providing users with a reliable tool for optimizing their vehicleâ€™s charging strategy and battery maintenance.
