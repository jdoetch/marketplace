The Tesla_Enable_Valet_Mode component provides an automated solution for enabling valet mode in Tesla vehicles. Developed to interact seamlessly with the Tesla API, it ensures a secure and restricted use of the vehicle when under valet services. The process involves triggering the component which then interacts with Tesla systems to perform the required operation, ensuring the vehicle remains secure and its functionality limited as needed.
