# Rapid7 Threat Command - Unassign Alert: Technical Documentation

## Overview
The "Rapid7 Threat Command - Unassign Alert" component is designed to facilitate the management of alert assignments within a security environment by unassigning an alert from all users. This documentation describes the individual actions, their purpose, inputs, outputs, and the flow of the process.

## Component Summary
This component consists of two main actions which work in conjunction to ensure that alerts can be dynamically unassigned from all users to manage response effectively and efficiently.

### Actions

#### 1. Unassign Alert
- **Type:** Connector
- **Purpose:** This action is responsible for removing an alert previously tied to one or more users in the system.
- **Inputs:** The action requires the alert `id` as an input.
- **Outputs:** Success or failure status of the unassignment action.
- **On-Success:** Proceeds to the result transformation action.
- **On-Failure:** Terminates the process, logging an appropriate error message.

#### 2. Component Result
- **Type:** Transformation
- **Purpose:** Handles the output from the Unassign Alert action and prepares a final result display.
- **Inputs:** Response from the Unassign Alert action.
- **Outputs:** Provides a transformed result indicating success or descriptive error message if the unassign action failed.
- **On-Complete:** Ends the component process.

## Process Flow
### Start
1. **Initiation:** The component is invoked with the necessary ID for the alert. 
2. **Action - Unassign Alert:**
   - The alert ID is passed to the Rapid7 Threat Command to unassign the alert.
   - On successful execution, moves on to the Component Result action.
   - On failure, the process exits, reporting failure.
3. **Action - Component Result:**
   - Takes the result from the previous action.
   - Transforms the result for final output.
   - On completion, marks the end of the component workflow.

### End
The workflow concludes with either a transformed outcome showing the action was carried out successfully or an error delineating why the process was unsuccessful, allowing for troubleshooting or further actions if necessary.

## Conclusion
This document provides guidelines and detailed descriptions for the "Rapid7 Threat Command - Unassign Alert" component within an operational environment. It aims to give clarity on each step, from initiation to conclusion, facilitating efficient management and operation of the security alerts unassignment process.
