# MxToolbox - Perform ICMP Trace Route

## Overview
The MxToolbox - Perform ICMP Trace Route component is designed to harness the power of ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) to perform trace routing. This process enables users to track the path that a packet takes from a source machine to its destination host via an animated route map displaying each hop. This component is crucial for network diagnostics and troubleshooting, giving a detailed view into the route paths and helping identify network congestion points or failures.

## Summary of the Component
The MxToolbox - Perform ICMP Trace Route component is integral in network security as it assists in visualizing and understanding the physical layout of paths data packets take across the network. By providing this detailed insight, it can assist network security specialists in proactively diagnosing problems before they impact network performance, or in reactive measures to trace back intrusions or anomalies.

### Components and Actions
- **Enrichment - Create Error**:
  - **Type**: Transformation
  - **Purpose**: To enrich the error logs with details about incidents that have occurred or anomalies detected during the trace routing; includes reputational insights based on error sources.
  - **On-Success**:
    - Continue to post results step.
  - **On-Failure**:
    - Log error details and abort current transaction.
  - **On-Complete**:
    - Archive the results into the database.

### Process Flow Summary
1. **Initialization**: Receive the request from the user to perform ICMP Trace Route.
2. **Enrichment Execution**: Run the enrichment procedure to append detailed error insights.
3. **Post Execution Handling**:
   - On success, capture enriched data and present it to the user.
   - On failure, log error specifics and notify the end-user or system administrator.
4. **Completion**: Archive the transaction and cleanup resources.

This flow provides a structured approach to error handling during the ICMP Trace Route, ensuring errors are not just caught, but enriched with actionable insights before concluding the process. This enhances the security and efficiency of network diagnostics over time.
