This GROUP-IB Get Incident component automatically ingests incoming GROUP-IB Incidents into your Turbine use cases for analysis, enrichment and response. This component transforms and maps incoming data to Swimlane's Turbine Extendable Data Schema. This common data model allows security practitioners to standardize data across many security tools for common security events, enrichments and remediations in Swimlane's Turbine platform.
