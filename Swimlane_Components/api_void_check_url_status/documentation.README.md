# API Void - Check URL Status Component Documentation

## Overview
The "API Void - Check URL Status" component is designed for systems that require verification of URL statuses to ensure the effectiveness of network security measures and operational functionality. This component integrates with external APIs to check the availability and status of specific URLs, which is crucial for security operations and IT management.

## Component Summary

### Purpose
The core purpose of this component is to allow systems to automatically verify the status of URLs. This is particularly useful for maintaining security standards and operational integrity by swiftly identifying and addressing issues related to the accessibility and status of critical URLs.

### Actions Overview
- **Enrichment - Create Error**: This is a transformation-type action within the component. It enriches the incoming data with error details captured during URL status checks.
  - **Type**: Transformation
  - **Description**: Enriches data based on error outputs from URL status checks.
  - **Inputs**:
    - **error_provider**: The source of the error.
    - **error_status**: Status code related to the error.
    - **error_result**: Detailed result or message from the error.

#### Subsequent Steps
1. **On Success**: Proceeds with further pre-defined operations or ends the workflow if it's the final action.
2. **On Failure**: Triggers defined error handling protocols.
3. **On Complete**: Completes the enrichment and processes it forward as configured.

### Overall Process Flow
1. **Initialization**: The component starts by identifying which URLs need status checks.
2. **Action Execution**: Executes the “Enrichment - Create Error” action to handle any errors encountered during the URL check process.
3. **Post-Action Workflow**:
   - On successful execution: Moves data to next steps such as logging or notification.
   - On failure: Activates failure handling pathways, which could include retry mechanisms or alerts.
4. **Completion**: After all actions are processed, the workflow completes, either returning results of operations or ending with the final state of actions.

## Conclusion
"API Void - Check URL Status" is designed to be versatile and critical for security and operational infrastructures, providing a reliable mechanism to monitor and assess URL statuses, thus fostering a proactive environment in network management.
