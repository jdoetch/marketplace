# SSC - Remove IP Domain Tag from a IP Domain Tag Group

## Overview
The "SSC - Remove IP Domain Tag from a IP Domain Tag Group" component is designed to automate the process of disassociating IP domain tags from specific tag groups using SecurityScorecard's API. This component simplifies the management of domain tags which assists users in maintaining the accuracy and relevancy of domain categorizations relevant to security assessments.

## Component Summary
This component undertakes the abstraction of the complexity associated with API interactions for tag management, providing structured actions to securely and efficiently remove tags from domain tag groups. Each action within the component is followed by a validation step to ensure the success of the operation, enabling a responsive and reliable automation mechanism.

### Component Actions
1. **Create Variables**
   - **Type**: Create Variables
   - **Purpose**: Initializes necessary variables for the component.
   - **On-Success**: Moves to the `Request` action.
   - **On-Failure**: Action sequence stops.

2. **Request**
   - **Type**: HTTP Request
   - **Purpose**: Executes the API call to SecurityScorecard to remove a specified tag from a group.
   - **On-Success**: Transitions to `Create Enrichment` if the API response is successful.
   - **On-Failure**: Triggers the `Normalize Create Error` action to handle errors.

3. **Create Enrichment**
   - **Type**: Transformation
   - **Purpose**: Processes the response from the `Request` action to structure the data appropriately.
   - **On-Success**: Advances to `Update Enrichment`.
   - **On-Failure**: Stops further actions.

4. **Normalize Create Error**
   - **Type**: Connector
   - **Purpose**: Normalizes error responses into a standard format for logging or further processing.
   - **On-Success**: Leads back to `Update Enrichment` for reattempt or review.
   - **On-Failure**: Ends the process with an error state.

5. **Update Enrichment**
   - **Type**: Update Variables
   - **Purpose**: Updates the enrichment information based on the outputs of either `Create Enrichment` or `Normalize Create Error`.
   - **On-Success**: Completes the component process successfully.
   - **On-Failure**: Concludes with failure status.

## Process Flow Summary
The component starts by establishing necessary variables, followed by executing an API request to remove a tag from a tag group. Depending on the result of the API call, it either processes the successful response to refine the data or handles errors by normalizing them. This ensures that the management of IP domain tags is both dynamic and robust, supporting security operations efficiently.
