# Technical Documentation: Securonix SNYPR - Run Activity Query

## Overview
The Securonix SNYPR - Run Activity Query component is an integral tool designed for querying activity data within a security framework. It leverages the Securonix SNYPR platform to run complex activity searches, facilitating automated threat detection and analysis in a streamlined and efficient manner.

## Component Summary
This component utilizes the Securonix SNYPR connector to execute specified activity queries based on user inputs ranging from specific event time frames to query details. The component simplifies security analysts' tasks by providing detailed insights into activity logs, aiding in rapid threat identification and response.

### Primary Actions
1. **Run Activity Query**
   - **Type:** Connector
   - **Purpose:** Executes an activity query on the Securonix SNYPR platform.
   - **Inputs:** Includes parameters such as query string, time frames for events, timezone, and JSON output preferences.
   - **Outcome:**
     - **On Success:** Proceeds to result processing.
     - **On Failure:** Handles errors without further processing.

2. **Component Result**
   - **Type:** Transformation
   - **Purpose:** Transforms the output of the activity query into a usable format.
   - **Input Processing:** Applies transformations to the activity query results to prepare data for further analysis or alerting.
   - **Outcome:**
     - **On Success:** Finalizes the component by publishing results.
     - **On Failure:** Handles errors and cleans up resources.

### Process Workflow
The workflow of this component starts with the initiation of the "Run Activity Query" action. Based on the input parameters provided by the user, the action queries the Securonix platform. Upon successful retrieval of data, the flow passes to the "Component Result" where the data is transformed for usability. The component handles any failures in either step appropriately, ensuring that the system remains robust in various scenarios.

### Detailed Flow Analysis
- **Data Input**: Users input relevant query parameters which include the specific details and conditions for the activity logs they are interested in.
- **Query Execution**: Executes the activity query using the Securonix SNYPR API.
- **Data Transformation**: Takes the raw query results and transforms them according to defined rules to make the data suitable for analysis or reporting.
- **Result Publication**: After successful transformation, the results are published for downstream use, such as in dashboards or alerts.

## Environment and Dependencies
- **Required Environment**: Needs connectivity with the Securonix SNYPR environment with appropriate configurations for accessing the API.
- **Dependencies**: Relies primarily on the connectivity established via the Securonix connector.

## Conclusion
The Securonix SNYPR - Run Activity Query is a pivotal component in the security operational workflows. It automates the process of data querying and analysis, enhancing the detection and response capabilities within the deployed environment.
