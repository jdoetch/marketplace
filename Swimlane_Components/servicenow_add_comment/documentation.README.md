# ServiceNow - Add Comment Component Documentation

## Overview
The "ServiceNow - Add Comment" component is designed to allow users to add comments to incidents within ServiceNow seamlessly through an automated process. This component leverages ServiceNow's APIs to interact directly with incident tables, adding operational efficiency and accuracy in incident management tasks.

## Summary of Component
The component consists of two main actions:
1. **Add Comment**: This action interacts directly with the ServiceNow API to post a comment to an incident.
2. **Generate Summary**: This subsequent action generates a summary based on the outcome of the Add Comment action, reporting on the success or failure of the comment posting.

### Detailed Action Descriptions

- **Purpose**: To add a user-generated comment to a specified incident in ServiceNow.
- **Inputs**:
  - sys_id: The identifier for the incident to which the comment will be added.
  - comment: The actual text of the comment to be added.
- **Process Flow**:
  - The action sends a request to the ServiceNow API endpoint to add the comment to the incident identified by sys_id.
  - **On Success**: Triggers the Generate Summary action.
  - **On Failure**: An error message is generated, but specifics of subsequent steps are not detailed in the provided YAML.

## Overall Process Flow Summary
1. **Start**: The component is triggered via an external call that provides necessary parameters (sys_id and comment).
2. **Add Comment**: Executes the API call to ServiceNow to add the specified comment.
