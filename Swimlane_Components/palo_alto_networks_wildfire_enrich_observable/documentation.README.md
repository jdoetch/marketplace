# Wildfire - Enrich Observable: Technical Documentation

## Overview 
Wildfire - Enrich Observable is designed to enhance the automation and analysis processes within security operations. Leveraging Palo Alto Networks' Wildfire technology, this component automates the enrichment of observables through various integrated actions, improving both the response times and accuracy of threat detection and analysis. 

## Summary of the Component
The Wildfire - Enrich Observable component is structured to refine the detection and validation processes by analyzing observables submitted to Wildfire. This involves creating enrichment variables, initiating HTTP requests to submit files for analysis or retrieve file hashes, handling outputs, and transforming responses into actionable security intelligence.

## Actions Detailed Description
### Create Enrichment Variables
**Type**: Create Variables
**Purpose**: Defines necessary variables for enriching observables, such as provider details and response arrays.
- **On Success**: Proceed to Conditional Parallel Action
- **On Failure**: No specific actions defined
- **Inputs**: 
  - Enrichment Provider: Set to Palo Alto Wildfire
  - Enrichment: An array placeholder
  - Loop array: Placeholder array elements
  - Break: Boolean set to false

### Conditional Parallel Group
**Type**: Parallel Group
**Purpose**: Manages execution based on the result of the observable type check.
- **On Completion**: Proceed based on condition checks, primarily related to the type of observable being processed.

### File Analysis Actions
**Type**: Conditional
**Purpose**: Checks if the provided observable is a file and if conditions are met, further analysis is done by designated actions.
- **On Success**: Conditional actions based on observable being a file
- **Conditions**: Observable type must match file

### HTTP Submission for File Analysis
**Type**: HTTP
**Purpose**: Submits file for analysis to Wildfire's API.
- **On Success**: Loop back for continuation or finish based on conditions.
- **On Failure**: Create Error Enrichment file
- **Inputs**:
  - API key, file details for HTTP POST submission
  - Endpoint: Wildfire submission API URL

### File Hash Retrieval
**Type**: Transformation
**Purpose**: Retrieves the file SHA hash which is used in subsequent requests to fetch analysis results.
- **On Success**: Submit hash for verdict retrieval

### Error and Response Handling
Tasks for managing both the successful responses and errors are established, with specific actions predetermined for updating enrichment data or handling errors appropriately.

## Overall Process Flow Summary
1. Initialization from start or designated entry points.
2. Execute creation of variables for enrichment purposes.
3. Analyze the observable to determine the appropriate processing action.
4. Submit the observable for analysis via Wildfire API.
5. Loop based on conditions to handle multiple or ongoing analyses.
6. Extract and translate response data into structured formats for further use within the security operations.
7. Based on the analysis results, update the enrichment data or handle exceptions as configured.

This automation and analysis flow leverages Palo Alto's Wildfire technology to improve the accuracy and speed of response in security operations, making the Wildfire - Enrich Observable a key component in threat detection and analysis processes.
