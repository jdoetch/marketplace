# Overview

This document describes a playbook that initializes variables, validates input, interacts with an external system to lift endpoint containment, checks containment status, handles errors, and ultimately provides transformed results. The process is intended for end users who need to understand the technical flow, data transformations, and error handling within the playbook.

# Process Flow

1. The playbook starts by creating initial variables from provided input.
2. It extracts a single identifier from an input array.
3. It runs validation checks in parallel with other operations. If validation succeeds, the process continues to interact with an external endpoint containment system. If validation fails, it records the error.
4. After attempting to lift containment, the playbook verifies the endpoint's status and, if necessary, retries until the desired status is achieved or an error occurs.
5. The playbook transforms the gathered results into a final structured output and updates a variable with these results.
6. It publishes results and error information for downstream use.

# Action Details

## Create_Variables
Type: createVariables  
Purpose: Initializes the variables required by subsequent actions.  
On success, it moves on to the action that retrieves a single identifier.  

## Get_ID
Type: transformation  
Purpose: Extracts a single identifier from the array of inputs.  
On success, it triggers the parallel execution block.

## Conditional_Parallel
Type: parallelGroup  
Purpose: Runs conditional checks and subsequent actions in parallel.  
On success, it proceeds to transform and store final results.

Within this parallel block:

### Input_Validation
Type: conditional  
Checks if the extracted identifier meets the requirements for the endpoint action.  
If the validation fails, it directs the flow to the Input_Validation_Error action.

### Input_Validation_Error
Type: python  
Raises an error when input validation fails.  
On success, it updates the ActionError variable.

### liftContainedEndpoint
Type: connector  
Attempts to lift endpoint containment using an external service.  
On success, it retrieves host information to verify containment status.  
On failure, it triggers the Action_Error_for_Contain_Host action.

### Action_Error_for_Contain_Host
Type: python  
Handles errors from the lift containment action.  
On success, it updates the ActionError variable.

### Get_Host_Info_for_Containment_Status
Type: connector  
Retrieves host status information to confirm successful containment lifting.  
Includes retry logic until the host is confirmed in the desired state.  
On success, updates the ActionError variable with host-related information.  
On failure, calls the Action_Error_for_Contaiment_Status action.

### Action_Error_for_Contaiment_Status
Type: python  
Handles errors occurring during host containment status checks.  
On success, it updates the ActionError variable.

### Update_Action_Error_for_Input_Validation, updateVariables_a2xim, updateVariables_au6qp, Update_Action_Error
Type: updateVariables  
Each of these updates the ActionError variable with relevant error details from previous actions.

## Get_Results
Type: transformation  
Assembles data from previous actions into a structured results array.  
On success, it calls the Update_Result_Variable action.

## Update_Result_Variable
Type: updateVariables  
Stores the transformed results from Get_Results into a final result variable.

# Inputs and Outputs

Inputs include an array of identifiers. The playbook extracts a single identifier for further processing.

Outputs include a structured results array with details of the containment action, the host's final status, and any errors captured in the ActionError variable.

# Summary

The playbook sets up variables, validates input, executes a connector action to lift endpoint containment, verifies the endpoint status, and handles errors gracefully. Results are transformed into a final structured output and stored in a variable for easy consumption by downstream consumers.
