# Censys - Aggregate Host Data Component Documentation

## Overview
The "Censys - Aggregate Host Data" component is designed to streamline the process of aggregating and enriching host data using specified enrichment providers. This serves the primary purpose of enhancing data intelligence that helps in maintaining robust network security and compliance by leveraging external data sources efficiently.

## Component Summary
The "Censys - Aggregate Host Data" component operates by initiating a data enrichment process, particularly focusing on error-related data from hosts. It employs a transformation action to integrate and enhance raw data, which subsequently aids in the decision-making process related to security operations.

### Actions
#### Error Enrichment
- **Type**: Transformation
- **Purpose**: This action aims to enrich error data received from host systems. It aggregates various error details into a structured format that can be readily utilized in security analysis.
- **On-Success**: Proceeds to finalize the aggregation process.
- **On-Failure**: Redirects to error-handling mechanisms.
- **On-Complete**: Ensures all processes terminate correctly and data is published as configured.

#### Inputs
  - Error Provider: Identifies the source of the error data.
  - Error Result: Capture the details of the error result.
  - Error Status: Details the status of the error involved.

### Process Flow
1. **Initiation**: Triggered manually or by another system event that identifies the need for data aggregation.
2. **Data Transformation**: The core action (Error Enrichment) transforms the incoming raw data related to errors into a comprehensive error report.
3. **Success/Failure Handling**: Depending on the success or failure of the data transformation, the flow either progresses to completion or error handling.
4. **Completion**: On successful transformation, finalizes data aggregation and prepares for publishing.

## Overall Flow Summary
This component is vital for organizations looking to automate the process of data collection and enhancement from various hosts. It integrates seamlessly with external data sources to fetch, transform, and refine data, fostering an environment of improved data intelligence and security readiness.
