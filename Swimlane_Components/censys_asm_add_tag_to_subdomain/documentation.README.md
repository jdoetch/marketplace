# Censys ASM - Add Tag to a SubDomain

## Overview
The "Censys ASM - Add Tag to a SubDomain" component is designed for efficient management and tagging of subdomains within the Censys ASM platform. This component allows users to automate the process of applying specific tags to identified subdomains, improving the organization and accessibility of subdomain-related data for further analysis and monitoring.

## Purpose
The primary reason this flow exists is to streamline the organizational capabilities within the Censys ASM ecosystem, making it easier for users to categorize and locate specific subdomains based on predefined criteria and tags. This enhances security posture and operational efficiency.

## Detailed Component Actions
**Enrichment - Create Error**
- **Type:** Transformation
- **Description:** Handles errors during the enrichment process by creating specific error logs.
- **Steps:**
  - **On-Success:** Proceeds to the next step if no error occurs.
  - **On-Failure:** Logs the error details and stops further action.
  - **On-Complete:** Finalizes the logging process.
- **Transformations:**
  - Uses the `teds_error_enrichment` transformation to consolidate and format error details.

**Inputs:**
- **Type:** Object
- **Properties:**
  - `error_provider`: The source of the error.
  - `error_result`: The output result from the error.
  - `error_status`: The status code associated with the error.

## Process Flow
1. **Start:** The component initiates by checking the current state of the targeted subdomain.
2. **Error Handling:** If any error occurs during the initial tagging process, the error handling mechanism is triggered, activating the "Enrichment - Create Error" action.
3. **Transformation:** The error details are transformed into a structured format suitable for recording and analysis.
4. **Completion:** Depending on the outcome, the process either logs the error and halts or successfully completes and moves to the next operational step.

The component ensures a robust mechanism to manage errors efficiently, which maintains the reliability and stability of the subdomain tagging process within Censys ASM.

## Conclusion
The "Censys ASM - Add Tag to a SubDomain" component is pivotal for managing subdomain data through tagging, providing an organized framework for cybersecurity professionals to enhance monitoring and analysis capabilities within the Censys ASM platform.
