The "Tenable - Cancel Vulnerability Export" component facilitates effective resource management within Tenable's security solutions by allowing administrators to cancel ongoing or queued jobs for exporting vulnerabilities. By integrating this component, users can better allocate system resources by terminating non-essential exports that may impact system performance or delay higher-priority tasks.
