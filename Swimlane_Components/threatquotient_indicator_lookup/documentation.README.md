# Documentation: ThreatQuotient - Indicator Lookup

## Overview

The "ThreatQuotient - Indicator Lookup" component is designed to enhance cybersecurity automation by facilitating the lookup of security indicators directly from ThreatQuotient's database via an automated process. As threats evolve, quick and comprehensive access to indicator details becomes crucial. This component is engineered for high performance and reliability within security operations, ensuring that threat data is both accessible and actionable.

## Summary of the Component

The core functionality revolves around querying a security indicator by its unique identifier to fetch its details from ThreatQuotient, a known vendor for threat intelligence solutions. The component executes within a defined environment, connected through necessary assets and using specified input parameters.

## Action Descriptions

### Get Indicator Action

**Type**: Connector

**Purpose**: Retrieves detailed information about a threat indicator by its ID. This direct connection to ThreatQuotient's threat intelligence database ensures that the lookup is always up-to-date and relevant.

- **On Success**: Trigger the Success Response action to handle positive results.
- **On Failure**: Trigger the Failure Script action to handle any errors or exceptions encountered.
- **Subsequent Steps**:
  - On completion of the action, the workflow progresses directly to either success or failure paths based on the outcome of the lookup.

### Success Response Action

**Type**: Python Script

**Purpose**: Handles the data returned from the successful indicator lookup. Formats and prepares the output to be used in subsequent processes or logs.

### Failure Script Action

**Type**: Python Script

**Purpose**: Manages the errors or exceptions produced by the Get Indicator action. This script ensures any failure in the lookup process is captured and appropriately logged, facilitating error management and debugging.

## Overall Process Flow Summary

1. **Initialization**: The process begins with the Get Indicator action, which sends a request to ThreatQuotient to retrieve specific indicator data.
2. **Decision Point**: Determine the result of the ThreatQuotient query:
   - If successful, proceed to the Success Response action.
   - If a failure occurs, execute the Failure Script action.
3. **Completion**: Based on the outputs of either Success or Failure actions, the component concludes the execution cycle, providing either the looked-up indicator data or an error notification.

This structured and well-defined flow ensures that the component delivers reliable performance in operational environments, automating crucial parts of threat management workflows.
