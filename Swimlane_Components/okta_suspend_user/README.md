The "Okta - Suspend User" component is designed to automate the suspension of user accounts in the Okta platform, enhancing security measures and compliance by promptly disabling access when necessary. This component uses Okta's API to perform actions selectively based on the parameters set within the organizational policies.

NOTE: When adding the API Key to the asset for Okta it requires you to add SSWS as a prefix.  More details can be found in the Okta Management link below.
