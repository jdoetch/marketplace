This CrowdStrike Falcon Enrich Observables component takes incidents or raw security observables with additional context, metadata and other relevant intelligence from CrowdStrike Falcon. This component integrates with Swimlane's Turbine Extendable Data Schema. This common data model allows security practitioners to standardize data across many security tools for common security events, enrichments and remediations in Swimlane's Turbine platform.
