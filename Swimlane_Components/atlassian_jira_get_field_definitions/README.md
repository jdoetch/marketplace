The Jira Field Data Retrieval component automatically extracts field metadata from all issue types within a specified Jira project. This component retrieves detailed schema information for each field, including custom fields, making it invaluable for tailored Jira implementations. If persistent storage of the retrieved data is required, the component supports writing the data to a custom application for efficient storage and management.

 

The output for each field includes:

Issue Type

Field Name

Field Key

Field Type

Required Field

Field Options (if applicable, such as for dropdown lists)
