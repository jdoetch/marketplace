# Microsoft Defender - Get Incident Component (a35d2042-db58-47c5-b447-5e707ebef3fc) Documentation

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive details on the Microsoft Defender - Get Incident Component, designed for use within automation environments focusing on incident retrieval from the Microsoft Defender platform. This component simplifies the process of fetching incident-related information, aiding in the enhancement of security response capabilities.

### Purpose of this Component

The component serves to automate the retrieval of incident data from Microsoft Defender to ensure efficient incident management and response. This automation aids in reducing the response time and increases the accuracy of the incident management process in a security operations context.

## Summary of the Component

The component interacts with the Microsoft Defender application to obtain details of specific incidents. It handles various states of action, such as active, fail, queued, and success conditions. It facilitates not only the fetching of incident data but also managing the outcome of this action through subsequent steps defined by the on-success, on-failure, and on-complete parameters.

### Actions within the Component

#### Get Incident
- **Type:** Connector
- **Purpose:** Fetches the incident details from Microsoft Defender.
- **On-Success:** Updates variables associated with the incident.
- **On-Failure:** Generates an error result.

#### Create Variables
- **Type:** Utility
- **Purpose:** Initializes variables that store the results and related alerts from the get incident action.
- **On-Success:** Invokes the Get Incident action.
- **On-Failure:** Usually handled by an internal error management strategy.

#### Update Variables
- **Type:** Utility
- **Purpose:** Updates the previously created variables with the results of the Get Incident action.
- **On-Success:** This action does not trigger another action but completes the update process.
- **On-Failure:** No further action, as error handling occurs in the Create Results Error action.

#### Create Results Error
- **Type:** Transformation
- **Purpose:** Handles errors from the Get Incident action by creating an appropriate error message.
- **On-Success:** Updates the error variables.
- **On-Failure:** Typically, this step would end the workflow with a failure status.

#### Update Variables Error
- **Type:** Utility
- **Purpose:** Updates the error handling variables to reflect any issues encountered during the Get Incident action.
- **On-Success:** Ends the error handling process.
- **On-Failure:** No subsequent actions.

## Overall Process Flow Summary

1. **Initialization:** Begins with the "Create Variables" action to setup the environment.
2. **Incident Retrieval:** Executes the "Get Incident" action to fetch incident data.
   - On Success: Proceeds to "Update Variables" to store the retrieved data.
   - On Failure: Triggers "Create Results Error" to handle incidents where retrieval fails.
3. **Variable Updates and Handling Errors:**
   - Successful data retrieval leads to the "Update Variables" action to finalize the storage of incident information.
   - Handling of any errors during retrieval is managed by "Create Results Error," followed by "Update Variables Error."

This flow ensures that all operations related to the incident retrieval from Microsoft Defender are handled efficiently, providing clear steps for success and failure scenarios.
