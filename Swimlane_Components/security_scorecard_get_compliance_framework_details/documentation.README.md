## Overall Process Flow Summary
1. **Start:** The process begins with the Create Variables action, which sets up necessary parameters.
2. **HTTP Request:** An HTTP Request is made to fetch compliance framework details. 
3. **Data Processing:** Depending on the outcome, either proceed to Create Enrichment (on success) or Normalize Create Error Action (on failure).
4. **Enrichment Updates:** Post successful data acquisition and processing, update variables through the Update Enrichment action.
5. **Error Handling:** Any errors detected will be normalized using the Normalize Create Error Action.
