# Technical Documentation for Spamhaus - Query IPs

## Overview
The "Spamhaus - Query IPs" component is designed to provide a seamless interaction with the Spamhaus API for querying IP addresses that may be involved in spam or malicious activities. This document serves as a comprehensive guide detailing the functionalities, flow, and operations within this component which integrates with the Spamhaus API.

## Component Summary
The Spamhaus - Query IPs component consists of multiple actions which handle the process of authenticating, querying, and processing data from the Spamhaus database. Each action within the component is fashioned to execute a specific function, followed by subsequent steps based on the success or failure of the action.

### Process Flow
1. **HTTP Request for Spamhaus Token**
   - **Type**: HTTP request
   - **Purpose**: This initiates the component's interaction by requesting an authentication token from the Spamhaus API.
   - **On-Success**: Proceeds to retrieve the Bearer token.
   - **On-Failure**: Component halts and logs the error.
   
2. **Get Bearer Token**
   - **Type**: Transformation
   - **Purpose**: Transforms the response from the previous HTTP request into a usable Bearer token.
   - **On-Success**: Triggers the main query action to the Spamhaus database.
   - **On-Failure**: Component halts and logs the error.

3. **Query Spamhaus**
   - **Type**: HTTP request
   - **Purpose**: Uses the Bearer token to query IP addresses through the Spamhaus API.
   - **On-Success**: Passes the results to update the final results.
   - **On-Failure**: Component halts and logs the error.

4. **Update Results**
   - **Type**: Update variables
   - **Purpose**: Updates the componentâ€™s internal variables with the results from the query for further use or output.
   - **On-Success**: Component concludes operations or can trigger additional actions based on requirements.
   - **On-Failure**: Component halts and logs the error.

## Detailed Actions Description

### HTTP Request for Spamhaus Token
Initiates requests to the Spamhaus API endpoint to retrieve an authentication token. It includes parameters such as endpoint URL, request method, headers, and body content which comprises credentials necessary for authentication.

### Get Bearer Token
Processes the JSON response from Spamhaus to extract the authentication token. This action involves transformation techniques to parse JSON format and retrieve the token value.

### Query Spamhaus
With the authentication token set in the request header as Bearer, this action makes the actual query to the Spamhaus API. The endpoint URL in this action is formatted to include specific paths that direct the request to relevant datasets based on the IP data being queried.

### Update Results
This final action in the flow captures the query results and updates the internal variables of the component. This enables the component to output these results or use them in subsequent processes.

## Conclusion
The Spamhaus - Query IPs component automates the process of querying IP addresses against the Spamhaus database, helping identify potentially harmful IP addresses efficiently. This technical documentation outlines the process flow, detailed actions undertaken within the component, and their intended outcomes, ensuring proper understanding and efficient usage of the component.
