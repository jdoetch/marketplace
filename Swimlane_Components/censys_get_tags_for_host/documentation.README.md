# Censys - Get Tags for Host

## Overview
The "Censys - Get Tags for Host" component is designed to facilitate the automation of retrieving tags associated with a specific host within the Censys platform. This documentation provides a comprehensive guide describing the componentâ€™s functionality, including a summary, detailed action descriptions, and a process flow to enable users to fully leverage this tool in their operational environment.

## Component Summary
The component includes actions for interacting with the Censys platform's tagging system. It automates the process of fetching and managing host-related tags, which classifies and organizes host data based on various attributes and metrics. The main action in this component encapsulates the transformations and data handling required to process these tags effectively.

## Actions
### Enrichment - Create Error
- **Type**: Transformation
- **Purpose**: This action is designed to handle errors during the tagging operation by creating an enriched error log. It helps in diagnosing and responding to issues that occur during the tag fetching process.
- **Steps**:
  - **On-success**: Proceeds to the next action or ends if no further steps are defined.
  - **On-failure**: Logs the error and can trigger alternative flows or error handling mechanisms.
  - **On-complete**: Finalizes the error handling process and cleans up resources.

### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**:
  - `error_provider`: Specifies the source of the error.
  - `error_status`: Describes the status of the error.
  - `error_result`: Contains the result or payload from the error.

## Process Flow Summary
1. **Start**: The process begins when the host data triggers the component.
2. **Error Handling**: If an error occurs, the "Create Error Enrichment" action is triggered.
    - Enriches and structures the error data.
    - Decides the course based on the success or failure of the error logging.
3. **Completion**: On successful execution, proceeds to optional steps or ends the process.
4. **Post-execution**: Any post-execution strategies or cleanup processes are managed here.

The primary intent of the "Censys - Get Tags for Host" component is to streamline and automate the retrieval of tagging information which enhances the host data visibility in security assessments and operational monitoring.
