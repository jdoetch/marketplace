### Purpose
The **Censys ASM - Retrieve a Web Entity** component is developed to enhance security measures by facilitating the retrieval and analysis of web entities. It is used in environments where identifying vulnerabilities and managing web assets within cybersecurity frameworks is critical.

### Component Summary
The component engages with actions to process and enrich error data during its operations, significantly aiding in transforming and handling error scenarios efficiently.

#### Actions and Procedures
1. **Error Enrichment**:
   - **Type**: Transformation
   - **Description**: Enriches the data related to errors in web entities.
   - **On Success**:
     - Initiates further data processing tasks.
   - **On Failure**:
     - Terminates the action and logs the error.
   - **On Complete**:
     - Concludes the enrichment and outputs results.

#### Transformation: teds_error_enrichment
   - **Purpose**: Enhances error data including type, provider, and timestamps.
   - **Inputs**:
     - **Error Provider**: The source of the error.
     - **Error Status**: The status code associated with the error.
     - **Error Result**: Specific result or output from the error.

### Overall Process Flow
The execution begins with the **Error Enrichment** action, which is responsible for transforming incoming error data. Based on the success or failure of this action, subsequent steps are determined — on success, the process transitions to additional tasks, and on failure, it terminates with appropriate logging.
