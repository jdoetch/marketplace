# Carbon Black - Delete Sensor by Device ID

## Overview
The Carbon Black - Delete Sensor by Device ID component is designed to automate the process of deleting a sensor on a device using the Carbon Black Cloud platform. It is useful for organizations leveraging VMware Carbon Black for endpoint security. Deleting sensors through automation helps maintain operational efficiency and ensures swift responses to security incidents by removing endpoints that are no longer necessary or potentially compromised.

## Summary of the Component
This component consists of a sequence of actions orchestrated to delete a sensor by its device ID. The actions are defined as follows:

1. **Action Response**: Initializes variables needed for execution.
2. **Get Current Time**: Retrieves the current time to append to logs and outputs for action statuses.
3. **Delete Sensor**: Commands the Carbon Black Cloud to delete the sensor.
4. **Successful Delete Sensor**: Updates variable to reflect a successful deletion.
5. **Unsuccessful Delete Sensor**: Updates variable to indicate failure in deletion.

Each action is configured to handle success or failure to ensure that subsequent steps are correctly triggered, maintaining the flow's integrity.

## Detailed Actions

### Action Response
- **Type**: Create Variables
- **Description**: Initiate variables required for the life cycle of this component.
- **Subsequent Steps**:
  - **On Success**: Proceed to Get Current Time
  - **On Failure**: None
  
### Get Current Time
- **Type**: Transformation
- **Description**: Fetches the current time to maintain a timeline for the operationâ€™s log.
- **Subsequent Steps**:
  - **On Success**: Proceed to Delete Sensor
  - **On Failure**: None

### Delete Sensor
- **Type**: Connector
- **Purpose**: Interface with VMware Carbon Black Cloud to request deletion of a sensor specified by the device ID.
- **Description**: Commands the Carbon Black Cloud API to delete a particular sensor using the provided device ID.
- **Subsequent Steps**:
  - **On Success**: Trigger Successful Delete Sensor
  - **On Failure**: Trigger Unsuccessful Delete Sensor
 
### Successful Delete Sensor
- **Type**: Update Variables
- **Description**: Indicates that the sensor deletion was successfully executed.
- **Subsequent Steps**:
  - **On Success**: None
  - **On Failure**: None

### Unsuccessful Delete Sensor
- **Type**: Update Variables
- **Description**: Records a failure status which can be used for debugging and alerting.
- **Subsequent Steps**:
  - **On Success**: None
  - **On Failure**: None

## Overall Process Flow Summary
The component initiates by setting necessary variables followed by retrieving the current time. It then attempts to delete a sensor through the VMware Carbon Black Cloud connector. Depending on the outcome, it updates the status to either success or failure. This streamlined sequence ensures efficient management of sensor data within a security environment.
