This component streamlines the process of locking systems by utilizing the Isolate/Rejoin Hosts Remediation Action Interface. Designed for compatibility with SOC Solution content, it enables users to lock a system by providing the System ID as input. The output delivers a clear text message indicating whether the action succeeded or failed, ensuring efficient and actionable workflow integration.



Usage:

- Install the component

- Configure a JumpCloud asset with administrator privileges. Make sure to set the x_org_id field with your organization id.

- Create a playbook button in your application to lock a system and pass the host id to the component or add to your playbooks to automate the locking of a system.
