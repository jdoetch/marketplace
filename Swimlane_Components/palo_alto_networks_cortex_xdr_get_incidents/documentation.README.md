# Cortex XDR - Get Incidents Component Documentation

## Overview
The Cortex XDR - Get Incidents component serves a crucial role in the security operations workflow within the Swimlane environment. This component is designed to automate the process of retrieving detailed incident data from Cortex XDR, allowing security teams to quickly respond to threats. This technical documentation outlines the usage, configuration, and steps involved in the Cortex XDR - Get Incidents componentâ€™s execution process.

## Summary
This component fetches incident data based on specified criteria such as time range, severity, and other relevant incident attributes. With the integration configured in Swimlane, this component enables streamlined access to incident data which can aid in faster and more informed decision-making within the security operations.

## Detailed Flow Process
1. **Initialization**: The component activates by receiving a trigger based on user requirements or scheduled tasks.
2. **Data Fetching**:
   - **Action**: The main action involves sending a request to the Cortex XDR API to retrieve incident data.
   - **Type**: This is a transformation type action as it involves querying and fetching data.
   - **Purpose**: To gather comprehensive details about incidents that meet the query criteria.
   - **On-Success**: If the data is successfully retrieved, the process transitions to data parsing.
   - **On-Failure**: On failure, the component handles errors and can retry the request or notify the user.
3. **Data Parsing and Publishing**:
   - **Action**: The fetched data is parsed and formatted to comply with internal data structures.
   - **Type**: Transformation action.
   - **Purpose**: Ensuring that the incident data is in the proper format for integration into other security workflows or systems.
   - **On-Success**: The processed data is further published internally for use in incident response or reporting.
   - **On-Failure**: Error handling procedures are engaged to log or rectify the issues in the data parsing stage.
4. **Completion**:
   - **Action**: Finalizing the execution of the component.
   - **Purpose**: To cleanly finish the data retrieval and integration process, providing logs and reports of execution for auditing purposes.
   - **On-Success**: Generates success logs and notifications.
   - **On-Failure**: Records the failure details for further analysis.

## Overall Process Flow
The Cortex XDR - Get Incidents component operates in an ordered and sequential fashion to guarantee the security data's accuracy and timeliness. Beginning with initiation by triggers, executing data fetch operations, handling transformations, and finally completing the cycle with appropriate logging and notifications, this component forms an indispensable part of the security infrastructure by ensuring timely availability of critical incident information.

### Notes on Configuration
- **Endpoints**: Configure endpoints to ensure connectivity with Cortex XDR API.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to manage and troubleshoot API and data-related errors.
- **Security**: Secure API keys and endpoints to prevent unauthorized access.

## Conclusion
The Cortex XDR - Get Incidents component efficiently bridges the gap between incident detection in Cortex XDR and incident response workflows in Swimlane. By automating the data retrieval processes, this component plays a pivotal role in enhancing the overall security posture and readiness of an organization.
