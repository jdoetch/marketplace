# Documentation for Microsoft Defender - Get Machine Logon Users Component (4b51ae0f-10b7-4450-a394-e882ec1eff7d)

## Overview

The Microsoft Defender - Get Machine Logon Users Component is designed as part of security automation workflows to retrieve user logon information from machines managed by Microsoft Defender. This component helps IT security teams to quickly assess and track user access details, which is essential for managing security in large network environments.

## Component Summary

The component executes within a broader security automation framework, interacting with Microsoft Defender's APIs to fetch logon data. This involves making secure API calls, handling responses, and managing errors effectively.

### Process Flow

1. **Initialization**: The component starts by initializing the connection settings with Microsoft Defender.
2. **Data Fetching**: Executes the API call to retrieve logon data.
3. **Data Transformation**: Transforms the fetched data into the required format.
4. **Error Handling**: Catches and processes any errors that occur during the execution.
5. **Finalization**: Completes the process and returns the data to the calling system, or manages data storage as per configuration.

### Detailed Actions

- **Initialization**: Prepares the environment and settings for API interaction.
- **API Call**: Securely queries Microsoft Defender for logon data, using configured authentication and parameters.
- **Data Handling**:
    - **Success Path**: On successful API response, the data is formatted and passed on for further utilization or storage.
    - **Failure Path**: On API failure, error data is captured, an error log is generated, and the failure is handled as configured (e.g., retry, abort, alert).
- **Transformation**: Involves parsing and structurally modifying the raw data into a more useful format.
- **Output Management**: Depending on the configuration, the output can either be sent back to a calling system or stored directly within a designated data repository.

## Overall Flow Summary

The component effectively manages interactions with Microsoft Defender to retrieve and process user logon data. It is robust against failures and designed to provide clear and actionable outputs for security monitoring and auditing purposes. This automation component is vital for ensuring ongoing compliance and security posture management within environments protected by Microsoft Defender.
