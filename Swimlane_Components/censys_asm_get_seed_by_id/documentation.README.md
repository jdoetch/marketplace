# Censys ASM - Get a Seed by ID: Technical Documentation

## Overview
`Censys ASM - Get a Seed by ID` is a component designed to retrieve detailed information about a specific seed using its unique identifier. This component is integral to managing and auditing various operations within a network environment, focused on enhancing security and operational efficiency.

## Summary of the Component
The main flow of this component revolves around the execution of specific actions that facilitate the enrichment and handling of errors related to seeds in ASP environments. It leverages transformation types and jsonata to enrich data based on provided inputs.

## Actions Description
### Action: `create__error_enrichment`
**Type**: Transformation

**Purpose**:
This action focuses on creating error enrichments to handle and transform errors more effectively. It uses inputs related to the error, its status, and results, processing them to generate enriched, comprehensive error information.

**Subsequent Steps**:
- **On-Success**: The flow moves to subsequent actions if defined, enhancing further process or retries.
- **On-Failure**: Defines the action to be taken in case of a failure, like logging or triggering alternate flows.
- **On-Complete**: Concludes the action sequence either successfully or after handling exceptions.

**Transformation**: `teds_error_enrichment`
Details a specific transformation aimed at enriching error data based on set criteria like type, provider, and verdict among others, intended to streamline error analysis.

## Overall Process Flow Summary
The component starts by initiating the `create__error_enrichment` action which enriches error data based on predefined conditions and specifications. Upon successful completion or failure, appropriate steps are taken as configured in the flow involving condition checks, error logging, alternative processes on failure, and clean-up on completion.

Thus, `Censys ASM - Get a Seed by ID` plays an essential role by not only fetching the required seed identity but also ensuring any exceptions in the process are managed efficiently through its error enrichment strategy.

### Schemas and Data Handling
The component utilizes JSON schemas to define the structure of error inputs and the expected output from actions. It ensures data consistency and aids in validation during the transformation process.

### Enabled Features
This component remains enabled to constantly provide the capability of seed data retrieval and error management, vital for maintaining seamless operations and security.

## Conclusion
This component is a crucial tool in the robust management of ID-based seed retrieval processes in network environments, equipped with error handling and data enrichment capabilities to ensure high levels of efficiency and reliability in operations.
