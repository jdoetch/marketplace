## Actions and Workflow

### Action: Error Enrichment
- **Type**: Transformation
- **Description**: This action enriches error data by transforming received inputs into a structured error report.
- **Inputs**:
  - **Error Provider**: Details of the error origin.
  - **Error Status**: Current status of the error.
  - **Error Result**: Resultant data of the error process.
- **Process**:
  - **On Success**: Progresses to the next logical step based on the component logic.
  - **On Failure**: Executes predefined failure handling mechanisms to manage errors smoothly.
  - **On Complete**: Concludes the data enrichment, moving to data finalization.

## Process Flow
1. **Start**: The process begins by invoking the Error Enrichment action.
2. **Error Enrichment Execution**: 
   - Receives inputs such as Error Provider, Error Status, and Error Result.
   - Transforms the data into a structured format.
3. **Decision Points**:
   - **Success**: If the enrichment is successful, proceed as per the success route.
   - **Failure**: In case of failure, trigger the error handling procedures.
4. **Completion**: Post-success or handled failure, conclude the process, and prepare the data for any further required operations or reporting.

## Purpose of the Flow
The reason for implementing the Microsoft Defender - Get File Statistics Component is to bolster the data handling capabilities of security teams, providing enhanced and actionable insights into file-related statistics. This component effectively integrates with Microsoft Defender, thereby reinforcing the security monitoring frameworks with improved automation and precise error handling.
