3. Upon successful data retrieval, the flow checks if the specific group and user data are valid.
4. Using a Python script, it identifies the correct group ID from the list.
5. Once the group ID is confirmed, the component attempts to remove the user from the selected group.
6. The final status (success or failure) is communicated as the outcome of the component.

This automation streamlines user management related to group membership in Okta and increases efficiency in managing access controls. Properly handling this automation ensures correct access management, reducing the risks associated with incorrect group memberships.
