It automates the removal process by interacting with Okta's API to fetch user and group details, verify membership conditions, and execute the removal, thereby enhancing security and operational efficiency.

NOTE: When adding the API Key to the asset for Okta it requires you to add SSWS as a prefix.  More details can be found in the Okta Management link below.
