The Tesla_Honk_Horn component is a streamlined solution for remotely triggering the horn of a Tesla vehicle through its API. Developed by the vendor Swimlane, this component automates the process of sending a command to Tesla's server, which then transmits it to the vehicle, thus allowing for various functionalities such as security alerts or simple vehicle location in large parking areas.
