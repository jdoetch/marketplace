Summary
This component initializes variables, extracts a single host identifier, validates that identifier against expected conditions, and then attempts to retrieve host information from CrowdStrike Falcon. If any step fails, it records an actionable error. On successful completion, it returns the retrieved host information in a structured form.

Actions
Create_Variables  
Type: createVariables  
Purpose: Defines and initializes variables, including a host identifier, a result object, and an ActionError object.  
On success: Calls Get_Host_Id.

Get_Host_Id  
Type: transformation  
Purpose: Extracts the first element from the provided host identifier array, making it available for downstream actions.  
On success: Calls Conditional_Parallel.

Conditional_Parallel  
Type: parallelGroup  
Purpose: Executes multiple validation and retrieval steps in parallel. If the validation passes, it proceeds with retrieving host information. If it fails, it raises an error.  
On success: Calls Get_Results.

Within Conditional_Parallel, the following actions are run:

Input_Validation  
Type: conditional  
Purpose: Checks if the extracted host identifier matches expected criteria.  
On success: Continues parallel processing if conditions are met.  
Else route: If validation fails, calls Input_Validation_Error.

Input_Validation_Error  
Type: python  
Purpose: Raises a custom error when the input validation fails.  
On success: Calls Input_Validation_Update_Action_Error.

Input_Validation_Update_Action_Error  
Type: updateVariables  
Purpose: Updates the ActionError variable with the output of Input_Validation_Error.  
On success: No further actions.

Get_Host_Info  
Type: connector  
Purpose: Uses CrowdStrike Falcon to retrieve host information for the given host identifier.  
On success: Calls Action_Error_Update.  
On failure: Calls errorRaise.

Action_Error_Update  
Type: updateVariables  
Purpose: Updates the ActionError variable indicating that the action completed.  
On success: No further actions.

errorRaise  
Type: python  
Purpose: Raises an error if the retrieval of host information or related steps fail.  
On success: Calls Update_Action_Error.

Update_Action_Error  
Type: updateVariables  
Purpose: Updates the ActionError variable with details from the error raised by errorRaise.  
On success: No further actions.

Action_Error_Update (already described above) is used again in the flow to finalize error-related variables.

Get_Results  
Type: transformation  
Purpose: Transforms the retrieved host information into a structured output format.  
On success: Calls Update_Result_Variable.

Update_Result_Variable  
Type: updateVariables  
Purpose: Updates the result variable with the transformed host information.  
On success: No further actions.

Process Flow Summary
The process starts by creating and defining the necessary variables. It then retrieves a single host identifier from the provided array. Next, it enters a parallel execution step to validate that the host identifier is correct. If validation fails, the process records an input validation error. If validation succeeds, it queries CrowdStrike Falcon for host information.

If any step fails in retrieving host information, it raises an appropriate error and updates the ActionError variable. Once the retrieval is successful, the component transforms the results and updates the result variable.

In conclusion, the component begins with variable setup, validates the host identifier, retrieves host data, handles any errors along the way, and ends by providing a final structured result.
