# Spamhaus - Query for Domains Component Documentation

## Overview

The "Spamhaus - Query for Domains" component is designed to facilitate intelligence gathering on domains by querying the Spamhaus database through an integrated approach. This component automates HTTP requests, handles authentications, and processes results for domain-based queries, aiming to enhance cybersecurity operations.

## Component Summary

"Spamhaus - Query for Domains" sequences several actions in a coordinated operation to ensure effective domain checks are executed with record updates, resulting in efficient threat intelligence gathering. Starting with credentials setup and ending with result assimilation, the process is streamlined to handle successful and unsuccessful responses diligently.

### Actions Description

#### 1. Create Variables
- **Type:** Create Variables
- **Purpose:** Initializes the required variables to store necessary credentials and results.
- **On-Success:** Proceeds to get Spamhaus token.
- **On-Failure:** There is no action specified for failure recovery at this stage.

#### 2. Get Spamhaus Token
- **Type:** HTTP
- **Purpose:** Authenticate against the Spamhaus API to retrieve an access token.
- **Description:** This step involves sending a request to Spamhaus API's login endpoint.
- **On-Success:** Extracts bearer token from the response.
- **On-Failure:** No specific action is defined.

#### 3. Extract Bearer Token
- **Type:** Transformation
- **Purpose:** Extracts the bearer token from the HTTP response for use in subsequent queries.
- **On-Success:** Proceeds to query Spamhaus with the extracted bearer token.
- **On-Failure:** No navigation defined on failure to extract token.

#### 4. Query Spamhaus
- **Type:** HTTP
- **Purpose:** Uses the bearer token to query domain data from the Spamhaus API.
- **Description:** Sends an authorized request to gather domain-related data.
- **On-Success:** Updates result block with the obtained data.
- **On-Failure:** No steps described for failure in querying.

#### 5. Update Result Block
- **Type:** Update Variables
- **Purpose:** Update the component state with the results from the Spamhaus query.
- **On-Success:** Completion of the process.
- **On-Failure:** No subsequent actions have been defined for failures at this stage.

## Process Flow Summary

The component initiates by preparing necessary variables, followed by authentication against the Spamhaus API. Upon receiving the authentication token, the component extracts it and uses it for querying domain details. Successfully retrieved data is then assimilated into the component's state for further use or analysis.

This automated flow ensures that users can consistently and efficiently pull relevant intelligence from Spamhaus regarding domain data, which is crucial for informed cybersecurity decisions.
