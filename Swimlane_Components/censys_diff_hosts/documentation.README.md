# Censys - Diff Hosts Component Documentation

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive technical description of the Censys - Diff Hosts component developed for IT security automation. The purpose is to assist users in understanding its configuration and operational dynamics. The component is structured to run within a security environment that leverages data transformation techniques for optimal threat intelligence.

### Component Summary
The Censys - Diff Hosts component is designed for enhancing security measures by analyzing host differences. It automatically identifies discrepancies in host configurations and helps in assessing potential security threats.

### Process Flow
1. **Error Enrichment**: The component begins by performing an error enrichment process to format and transform error data into structured intelligence. This procedure is vital for subsequent security tasks.
   - **Type**: Transformation
   - **On-Success**: Advances to the next steps.
   - **On-Failure**: Stops the process and logs the error.
   - **Description**: Converts error logs and responses into actionable security insights.

2. **Data Transformation**:
   - **Error Enrichment Content**:
     - Gathers data regarding error type, provider, and results.
     - Timestamps and permalinks the error for tracking.
     - Transforms the data into JSON format for further action.

3. **Publication and Output**:
   - On the successful completion of the error enrichment, processed data is ready for publication or integration into other systems for real-time response and actions.

### Overall Process Flow Summary
The component begins with the enrichment of error data, transforming it into a format suitable for security analysis. Based on the results, it either proceeds to subsequent security processes or halts due to encountered failures. The final step involves preparing enriched data for publication or further automated actions.

### Detailed Action Description
#### Error Enrichment:
- **Purpose**: To prepare and structure error data for analysis.
- **Input**:
  - **Error Provider**: Source of the error.
  - **Error Result**: Detailed outcome of the error.
  - **Error Status**: Status code of the error occurrence.

### Conclusion
The Censys - Diff Hosts component plays a critical role in modern IT security infrastructure by facilitating the automation of error handling and data transformation, thus contributing significantly to operational efficiency and threat response capabilities.
