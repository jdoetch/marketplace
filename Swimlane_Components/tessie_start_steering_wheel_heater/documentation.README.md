# Tesla_Start_Steering_Wheel_Heater Component Documentation

## Overview
The Tesla_Start_Steering_Wheel_Heater component is designed to provide integration capabilities with specific vehicle systems to activate the steering wheel heating functionality. This technical documentation aims to guide users through the individual actions involved within the component and to describe their relationships and data flow in detail.

## Summary of the Component
The Tesla_Start_Steering_Wheel_Heater component serves the primary function of initiating the heating of a Tesla vehicle's steering wheel via a remote API call. It is advantageous for enhancing the comfort of vehicle occupants particularly in cold conditions. The component achieves this through a sequence of actions aligned with best practices for secure and reliable remote interactions with vehicle systems.

## Process Flow Summary
- **Phase 1: Start Heating**
   - The action begins with a direct API call to the Tesla system, initiating the steering heater.
   - **Endpoints**: Utilize specific API endpoints for activating the steering heater.
   - **Heating Activation**: An HTTP request is made to trigger the mechanism within the Tesla vehicle.

- **Phase 2: Result Handling**
   - **Success Case**: If the request executes successfully, the component handles this through predefined success paths.
   - **Failure Case**: In instances where the action fails, failure paths are pre-defined.
   
## Action Details

### tessie_start_steering_wheel_heater
- **Type**: HTTP Request
- **Purpose**: Sends a request to a Tesla API endpoint to start the steering wheel heater.
- **On-Success**: Advance to the subsequent `set_output` action.
- **On-Failure**: Predefined error handling measures are activated.
- **API Endpoint**: `https://api.tessie.com/{vin}/command/start_steering_wheel_heater`

### set_output
- **Type**: Transformation
- **Purpose**: Processes the results received from the `yessie_start_steering_wheel_heater` action and establishes the final output regarding the steering wheel heater's activation state.


## Overall Process Flow
The component starts with an action that sends an HTTP GET request to the Tesla API. Depending on the response, it either sets the output directly or handles errors if the activation fails. The progression from HTTP request to output setting is linear, ensuring clear and straightforward execution logic.
