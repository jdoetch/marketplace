# Tesla Component Technical Documentation

## Overview

The Tesla component is designed to orchestrate a series of HTTP-based actions aimed at interacting with the Tesla API for vehicle management tasks such as locking the vehicle, setting speed limits, and enabling speed limits. As a high-level automation component, it leverages transformation actions to process data from one action to the next, ensuring an intuitive flow of operations and data handling. 

## Component Summary

The Tesla component increases operation efficiency and automates routine tasks by interacting with Tesla vehicle APIs. Its primary functions are set within a structured process, ensuring specific tasks are performed sequentially and safely.

### Actions Description

The Tesla component encapsulates several actions:

1. **Set Speed Limit (`tessie_set_speed_limit`)**
   - **Type**: HTTP
   - **Purpose**: Sends a request to set the vehicleâ€™s speed limit.
   - **On-Success**: Triggers the `essie_enable_speed_limit` action.
   - **Inputs**:
     - Endpoint: Dynamically generated using vehicle identification (VIN)
     - Method: POST
     - Headers and query parameters for authentication and command execution.

2. **Enable Speed Limit (`tessie_enable_speed_limit`)**
   - **Type**: HTTP
   - **Purpose**: Enables the speed limit that was previously set.
   - **On-Success**: Executes the transformation `set_output` to finalize the output parameters.
   - **Inputs**:
     - Endpoint: Dynamically generated using vehicle identification (VIN)
     - Method: POST
     - Query Parameters: Includes `pin` as an input for operation security.

3. **Set Output (`set_output`)**
   - **Type**: Transformation
   - **Purpose**: Collates results from the `tessie_set_speed_limit` and `tessie_enable_speed_limit` actions and formats them for output.
   - **Inputs**: Receives inputs from the outputs of the aforementioned actions.

### Process Flow

Upon activation, the Tesla component begins with the `tessie_set_speed_limit` action. If successful, it then triggers the `tessie_enable_speed_limit`. Each action's success leads to another, culminating in the `set_output` action which consolidates and prepares the final output data.

### Error Handling

Each HTTP action includes error handling pathways. In case of failure at any action step, the system logs the error and halts further execution, ensuring system integrity and the opportunity for troubleshooting.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the Tesla component integrates complex business rules into actionable, secure, and effective HTTP requests that communicate with Tesla's API to manage vehicular functions remotely. This component is vital for efficient automation environments where managing vehicle settings remotely and securely is required.
