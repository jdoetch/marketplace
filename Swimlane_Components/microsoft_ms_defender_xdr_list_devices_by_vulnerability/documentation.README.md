# MS Defender XDR - List Devices by Vulnerability

## Overview
The "MS Defender XDR - List Devices by Vulnerability" component is designed to enhance cybersecurity management by automating the process of listing devices based on their vulnerabilities using MS Defender external resources. This process integrates smoothly with organization-specific workflows to facilitate a proactive approach to security management.

## Component Summary
At its core, the component has been developed to query MS Defender for a list of devices corresponding to specific vulnerabilities. By fully automating the task, it seeks not only to save time but also to increase the accuracy and consistency of security operations.

## Actions Overview
### Action: List Devices by Vulnerability
- **Type**: Connector
- **Purpose**: To fetch a list of devices that have a specific vulnerability, utilizing the Microsoft Defender API.
- **On-Success**:
  - Proceeds to summarize the success of the operation.
- **On-Failure**:
  - Triggers a Python script to handle and report the failure scenario.
- **Inputs**:
  - vulnerability_id: Specific ID of the vulnerability to lookup devices for.

### Subsequent Actions
1. **On Success**:
   - **Title**: Success
   - **Type**: Python script
   - **Description**: Runs a script to confirm and log the successful operation.
   - **Outputs**: "Successfully listed devices".

2. **On Failure**:
   - **Title**: Failure
   - **Type**: Python script
   - **Description**: Executes an error-handling script to address and log the failure causes.
   - **Outputs**: "Failed to list vulnerabilities by machine and software".

## Process Flow Summary
- The component starts with the main action of querying the list of devices by a specific vulnerability.
- Depending on the action's outcome, it either confirms the success or handles the failure.
- All actions are designed to ensure that there are clear and concise logs for both success and failure scenarios, simplifying troubleshooting and audits.

This well-structured component effectively enhances an organization's ability to manage and respond to vulnerabilities by providing a streamlined, automated insight into affected devices.
