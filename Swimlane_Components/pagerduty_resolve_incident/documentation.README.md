This document provides the complete technical documentation for the "PagerDuty - Resolve Incident" component. This component is designed to automate the process of resolving incidents in PagerDuty, a critical tool used by IT, DevOps, and support teams to ensure operational reliability. The primary function of this component is to streamline incident resolution, minimize response time, and maintain a high level of service quality.

## Component Summary

The "PagerDuty - Resolve Incident" component automates the incident resolution process by interacting with the PagerDuty API. Upon triggering, the component sends an HTTP request to modify the incident's status to "resolved."

   - **Failure Path:** If the HTTP request fails, the component handling ends.

2. **Get Response Action**
   - **Type:** Transformation
   - **Purpose:** Transforms the response data received from the HTTP request action.
   - **Input:** Data extracted from the HTTP request's response.
