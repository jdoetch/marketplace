The "PagerDuty - Resolve Incident" component is designed to automate the incident resolution process within PagerDuty. Utilizing HTTP requests, this component interacts directly with the PagerDuty API to update the status of an incident to "resolved." This automation streamlines operations, reduces response times, and enhances overall system reliability by ensuring incidents are resolved quickly and accurately.
