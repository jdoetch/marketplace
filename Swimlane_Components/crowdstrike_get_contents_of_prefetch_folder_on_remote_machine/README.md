This component is designed to retrieve a host identifier, validate it, check the host’s online state using CrowdStrike, establish a real-time response (RTR) session, execute a command (ps), wait for a specified duration, retrieve the command output, and finally compile the results. Throughout the process, it handles errors by raising and recording them appropriately. Upon successful execution, it outputs the host’s online state and the command’s results.
