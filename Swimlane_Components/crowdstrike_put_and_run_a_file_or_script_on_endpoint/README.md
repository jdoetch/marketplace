This component is designed to facilitate the upload of files or scripts to the CrowdStrike Falcon Cloud. It validates input parameters, checks for existing files to prevent duplicates, uploads the specified file or script, retrieves confirmation of the upload, and compiles the results. Comprehensive error handling ensures that any issues encountered during execution are appropriately raised and recorded, enhancing the reliability and effectiveness of file management operations within the CrowdStrike Falcon platform.
