# Criminal IP - Check Domain Scan Status - Technical Documentation

## Overview
The Criminal IP - Check Domain Scan Status component aids in monitoring and managing the status of domain scans against known databases of malicious IPs, providing a crucial workflow for cyber security teams.

## Summary of the Component
This document outlines the functionality and flow of the "Criminal IP - Check Domain Scan Status" component. The component is designed to handle domain status checks and responses based on the scan results. This involves interactions with an IP reputation service to ascertain the status of domains related to criminal activities.

## Component Actions
- **Enrichment - Create Error**
  - **Type:** Transformation
  - **Purpose:** Initiates an enrichment process using provided error data.
  - **On-Success:** Proceeds to the next step in the flow, dependent on the specific use case.
  - **On-Failure:** Triggers are set to handle failures, such as logging the error or rerunning the enrichment.
  - **Transformations:** Involves data manipulation to format the error input received to match the requirements of downstream systems or databases.
  - **Inputs:**
    - *Enrichment Type:* Reputation
    - *Provider:* Derived from error
    - *Verdict:* Error indication
    - *Timestamp:* Capture time of the enrichment action
    - *Permalink and Content:* Provides reference and context to the enriched data

## Overall Process Flow
1. **Start:** The process begins when a domain check is initiated.
2. **Enrichment Creation:** Errors identified during the domain scan are formatted.
3. **Decision Making:** Depending on the output of the enrichment:
   - **Success Path:** The enriched data is processed to extract useful insights, potentially leading to further actions like alerting.
   - **Failure Path:** Error handling routines are engaged to address and log failures.
4. **Completion:** The component concludes its flow once the necessary actions based on the domain scan status and resultant data are performed.

This component ensures a robust mechanism for cyber security teams to verify and respond to domain reputation queries effectively, integrating seamlessly into broader security strategies.
