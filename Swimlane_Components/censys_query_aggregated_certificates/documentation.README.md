# Censys - Query Aggregated Certificates Component Documentation

## Overview
The "Censys - Query Aggregated Certificates" component is designed to facilitate the querying of aggregated SSL/TLS certificate data using the Censys API. This component is critical for cybersecurity and IT professionals who need to gather and analyze certificate information across many records. By automating this process, it streamlines data gathering, enhances error handling, and supports decision processes related to security assessments.

## Process Flow Summary
The component encapsulates key actions in a sequential and conditions-based workflow. Key actions include variable creation, data transformation, and HTTP requests to interface with external APIs (Censys API), followed by data enrichment and error normalization tasks.

### Actions Description

#### 1. Create Variables
   - **Type:** Create Variables
   - **Purpose:** Initialize variables required for further actions.
   - **On Success:** Proceed to Encode Query
   - **On Failure:** End the component

#### 2. Encode Query
   - **Type:** Transformation
   - **Purpose:** Transform query parameters into the format suitable for API requests.
   - **On Success:** Proceed to Create URL
   - **On Failure:** End the component

#### 3. Create URL
   - **Type:** Python (Script Action)
   - **Purpose:** Construct the URL needed for the API request by dynamically appending the serialized query parameters.
   - **On Success:** Issue an HTTP Request
   - **On Failure:** Normalize and report the error using Error ATWC

#### 4. HTTP Request (_Request)
   - **Type:** HTTP
   - **Purpose:** Make an HTTP request using the constructed URL to the Censys API.
   - **On Success:** Create Enrichment
   - **On Failure:** Normalize Error using Error ATWC

#### 5. Create Enrichment
   - **Type:** Transformation
   - **Purpose:** Transform and evaluate API response and prepare it for downstream processing.
   - **On Success:** Update Enrichment
   - **On Failure:** End the component

#### 6. Update Enrichment
   - **Type:** Update Variables
   - **Purpose:** Update enrichment data based on the latest query results.
   - **On Success:** Component successfully ends
   - **On Failure:** End the component

#### 7. Normalize Error ATWC
   - **Type:** Connector
   - **Purpose:** Standardize error responses and facilitate uniform error handling.
   - **On Success:** Update Enrichment (Error Handling)
   - **On Failure:** End the component 

### Entry Points
- **Create Variables**: Initiates the component with variable setup.

### Handling of Errors and Outputs
Errors are normalized and appropriate error messages are generated and passed through the flow for standardized handling across systems. Outputs from each step are meticulously designed to ensure seamless data transition and integration with other components or systems.

### Environmental and Contextual Considerations
The environment setup ensures secure data handling, appropriate timeouts, and relies on robust API integrations with error and retry logic in place to handle network-related and API-related unpredictabilities.

### Conclusion
The "Censys - Query Aggregated Certificates" component represents a vital utility within any security and compliance infrastructure, for effective certificates data handling, proactively aiding in risk management and compliance strategies.
