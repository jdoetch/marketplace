# HaveIBeenPwned - Check If Account is Breached Component Documentation

## Overview
The "HaveIBeenPwned - Check If Account is Breached" component is an essential security tool designed to check if an account has been compromised in any data breaches. This component interacts with the HaveIBeenPwned API to fetch breach details associated with email accounts.

## Component Summary
This component automates the process of checking email accounts against the HaveIBeenPwned database to identify potential security breaches. By automating this process, users can quickly determine if they need to take action to secure their accounts, such as changing passwords or implementing stronger security measures.

### Process Flow
1. **Create Variables**: Initialize necessary variables.
   - Success: Proceed to process each email address.
   - Failure: Log and stop execution.
2. **For Each Email Address**: Loop through each specified email address.
   - For each email address, fetch the breach details.
   - On completion of the loop, trigger the alert generation process.
3. **Get All Breaches for An Account**: For each email account, call the HaveIBeenPwned API.
   - Success: If data is retrieved, proceed to data normalization.
   - Failure: Log an error and proceed to the next email address.
4. **Normalize Data**: Convert the fetched breach data into a standardized format for alerts.
   - This involves structuring the data to suitable alert formats and inclusion in security monitoring tools.
5. **Generate Alerts**: Transform the normalized data into alerts.
   - Success: Update variables with the new alert data.
   - Failure: Log and stop execution for that particular email address.
6. **Update Variables**: Store the generated alerts for further use or external actions.

### Actions Description
- **Create Variables**: Initializes operations and set up necessary data structures.
- **For Each Email Address**: Iterates over provided email accounts to check each one individually.
- **Get All Breaches for An Account**: Connects to the HaveIBeenPwned API via a specified connector to retrieve breach data.
- **Normalize Data**: Transforms raw data into a structured format, ensuring uniform alert generation.
- **Generate Alerts**: Converts normalized data into actionable alerts.
- **Update Variables**: Updates the system variables with the newly generated alert data for use in further processes or integration points.

### Error Handling
This component includes error handling mechanisms at each critical step:
- Failing to create initial variables or connect to the API results in a logged error without proceeding further.
- Failures in data retrieval or processing result in continuity with the next item after logging the issue.

## Conclusion
The "HaveIBeenPwned - Check If Account is Breached" component is a critical part of security operations, helping identify compromised accounts quickly and efficiently. By automating the process, it ensures timely detection and response to potential security threats.
