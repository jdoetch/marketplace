# Technical Documentation: Censys ASM - Add a comment to a SubDomain

## Overview
This technical documentation outlines the operational details and step-by-step process of the Censys ASM component titled "Add a comment to a SubDomain." This component allows users to append comments to subdomains within their network infrastructure, facilitating enhanced monitoring and annotation of network entities.

## Component Summary
The "Censys ASM - Add a comment to a SubDomain" component is a crucial tool for network administrators and cybersecurity professionals who require an organized method to track and annotate subdomains. This component integrates seamlessly with existing Censys ASM setups to provide a straightforward solution for managing network-related comments.

### Actions
- **Title**: Enrichment - Create Error
  - **Type**: Transformation
  - **Description**: This action is responsible for creating error logs during the comment addition process, focusing on transforming error data into a structured format suitable for debugging and tracking.
  - **On-Success**: Proceeds to finalize the comment addition if there are no errors.
  - **On-Failure**: Executes error handling routines to manage and mitigate any issues encountered during the process.
  
### Subsequent Steps
- **On-Complete**: Ensures all operations related to comment addition have been finalized and logged accordingly.
- **Publish**: Publishes the final outcome of the comment addition to the designated system or dashboard for visibility and further action.
- **Transformations**:
  - **Title**: Error Enrichment
  - **Description**: Enhances the raw error data by appending additional metadata, making it more comprehensible for system administrators and audit trails.

## Overall Process Flow Summary
1. **Initialization**: Starts with the error enrichment action where errors are transformed and structured.
2. **Execution**:
   - Upon successful error handling, proceed to add the comment to the subdomain.
   - If an error is detected, manage the error and log it accordingly.
3. **Completion**:
   - After the comment is added or an error is handled, the system will finalize the process, ensuring all actions are completed as intended.
   - The result (success or failure) is then published to the appropriate system dashboard.

This flow ensures that the process of adding comments to subdomains is both efficient and error-resistant, providing a robust tool for network management.
