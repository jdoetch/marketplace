This component enables users to input an array of CSV, PDF, and TXT files of arbitrary length. It processes files individually by file type, then aggregates the results into a single array of objects containing each file’s name and its plain text content. Designed for handling arrays with multiple file types, it ensures seamless integration and efficient processing within workflows.
