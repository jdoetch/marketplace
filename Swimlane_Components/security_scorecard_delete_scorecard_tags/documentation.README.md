# SSC - Delete Scorecard Tags Component Documentation

## Overview

The "SSC - Delete Scorecard Tags" component is designed for automated management of Security Scorecard tags through selective deletion based on specified criteria. The component is part of a larger ecosystem, intended for users who require an efficient and error-minimized approach to maintaining the integrity and relevance of tags in their security assessments.

## Component Summary

This component provides tools for deleting tags in bulk from Security Scorecards. It stems from the need to manage large sets of data efficiently, while ensuring that tag management processes align with security policies and compliance requirements. The deletion process involves several steps, including variable creation, enrichment updates, and error handling to ensure that the deletions proceed successfully without impacting system stability.

## Detailed Process Flow

1. **Create Variables:**
   - Initializes necessary variables for processing.
   - On success, triggers the HTTP request to delete tags.
   - On failure, no further actions are triggered.

2. **HTTP Request:**
   - Executes an API call to the Security Scorecard service to delete specified tags in bulk.
   - On success, triggers the creation of enrichment to encapsulate the deletion details.
   - On failure, triggers error normalization to handle the occurred error appropriately.

3. **Create Enrichment:**
   - Processes the response from the HTTP request to form a structured enrichment document.
   - On success, continues to update the enrichment with new data.
   - On failure, ends the process with no further actions.

4. **Normalize Create Error:**
   - Handles errors from the HTTP request step by categorizing and logging them.
   - On success, proceeds to update the enrichment data.
   - On failure, no subsequent actions are triggered.

5. **Update Enrichment:**
   - Updates the previously created enrichment with new or revised information post-deletion process.
   - This is the final step in the sequence, designed to finalize the data structure for eventual logging or auditing purposes.

## Overall Process Flow Summary

The flow of the component begins with the initialization of variables necessary for the process, followed by an HTTP request to delete specific tags. Depending on the outcome of this request, it either directly proceeds to refine the enrichment created or handles errors if any occur. Post-error handling or successful deletion, the enrichment updates with new data to reflect the changes made, completing the component action sequence.

This structured flow ensures that each action is purposeful and that subsequent steps are contingent upon the success of preceding ones, thereby maintaining system integrity and aligning with best practices for security management.

### Error Handling:

- **Normalization of errors:** Categorizes and documents errors that occur during the HTTP request stage, aiding in troubleshooting and ensuring robust process handling.
- **Conditional flow steps:** Execution paths in the component are highly dependent on the outcomes (success or failure) of each action, which is critical for maintaining the operational integrity and for avoiding unnecessary processing.

This component not only ensures compliance and governance over the use of tags but also streamlines operations and minimizes human error through automation.
