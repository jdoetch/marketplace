## Overview of Tesla_Open_Charge_Port

The Tesla_Open_Charge_Port component is an automation sequence designed to control the charge port of a Tesla vehicle. This document details the comprehensive flow of this componentâ€™s deployment that interfaces with Tesla's charging equipment to allow conditional opening based on the vehicle's status.

### Summary of the Component

**Tesla_Open_Charge_Port** is structured to primarily enact two key actions:
1. **Set Output**: A transformation step that manages outputs based on input conditions.
2. **Tessie - Open Charge Port**: This is an HTTP request sent to Tesla's API to open the charge port.

Each action incorporates conditional logic handling responses to ensure high reliability and responsiveness. The component is fit for use in environments requiring high levels of automation and security.

This controlled sequence ensures that actions pertaining to the opening of the Tesla charge port are executed in an orderly and secure manner, allowing for both automation and manual oversight where necessary.
