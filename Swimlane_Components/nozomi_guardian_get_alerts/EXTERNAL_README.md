Swimlane Turbine components are standardized and modular automation building blocks that can be used and re-used across all of your applicable automation use cases.

This Nozomi Guardian - Get Alerts component automatically ingests incoming Nozomi Guardian - Get Alerts ingestion into your Turbine use cases for analysis, enrichment and response. This component transforms and maps incoming data to Swimlane's Turbine Extendable Data Schema. This common data model allows security practitioners to standardize data across many security tools for common security events, enrichments and remediations in Swimlane's Turbine platform.

This component empowers security teams to efficiently integrate OT/IoT security insights, automate alert management, and standardize data for improved incident response.
