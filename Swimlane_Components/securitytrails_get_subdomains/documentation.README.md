# SecurityTrails - Get Subdomains Component Documentation

## Overview
The "SecurityTrails - Get Subdomains" component is designed to automate the retrieval of subdomain information for a specified domain using the SecurityTrails API. This component is crucial for security operations and analysis, providing crucial domain footprint information that assists in security assessments and threat intelligence.

## Component Summary
The component leverages several actions to achieve its objectives:

### Actions
1. **Create Variables**
   - **Type:** CreateVariables
   - **Purpose:** Initializes the necessary variables for the operation.
   - **On Success:** Proceeds to SecurityTrails Get Subdomains action.

2. **SecurityTrails Get Subdomains**
   - **Type:** HTTP
   - **Purpose:** Fetches subdomains for a specific domain from SecurityTrails.
   - **Inputs:** Includes domain endpoint details.
   - **On Success:** Initiates teds_enrichment.
   - **On Failure:** Executes Normalize Create Error.

3. **Teds Enrichment**
   - **Type:** Transformation
   - **Purpose:** Handles the transformation of fetched data for enrichment.
   - **On Success:** Triggers Update Enrichment.

4. **Update Enrichment**
   - **Type:** UpdateVariables
   - **Purpose:** Updates the enrichment data processed from transformations.
   - **On Success:** Sequence ends or loops as configured.
   - **On Failure:** Triggers Normalize Create Error.

5. **Normalize Create Error**
   - **Type:** Connector
   - **Purpose:** Handles any errors or exceptions, normalizing them for error management or alerting.
   - **On Success:** Proceed to Update Enrichment Error.

6. **Update Enrichment Error**
   - **Type:** UpdateVariables
   - **Purpose:** Updates the enrichment data specifically during error handling.

### Process Flow
1. Initialize variables.
2. Retrieve subdomain data from SecurityTrails.
3. If retrieval is successful, process data for enrichment.
4. Update enrichment with new or adjusted data.
5. Handle any errors by normalizing and updating the error state.

This flow ensures that the component efficiently handles both successful operations and exceptions, maintaining robust operation across diverse scenarios.

## Conclusion
The "SecurityTrails - Get Subdomains" component is essential for those needing detailed domain information in cybersecurity operations. By automating domain data retrieval and enrichment, it supports thorough digital footprint analysis and enhances organizational security posture.
