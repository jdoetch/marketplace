# Microsoft OneDrive - Create Site Upload Session Component

## Overview
The component titled "Microsoft OneDrive - Create Site Upload Session" is designed to facilitate easier management and handling of file uploads in a high-volume and enterprise setting by creating dedicated upload sessions within Microsoft OneDrive. This component is essential for streamlining the process of large file uploads, ensuring data integrity, and managing network resources efficiently.

## Purpose
The primary reason for the existence of this flow is to provide a robust mechanism for creating and managing file uploads to Microsoft OneDrive, especially targeted at sites that require handling of large or numerous file uploads within a corporate environment.

## Component Summary
This component comprises a sequence of actions focused on transforming input data, handling errors, and managing file session lifecycles effectively for OneDrive sites.

### Actions
1. **Error Enrichment**
   - **Type:** Transformation
   - **Description:** Enhances error data with additional contextual information to aid in debugging and error handling processes.
   - **Subsequent Steps:**
     - **On Success:** Proceed without any specific action.
     - **On Failure:** No additional steps defined, error state maintained.
     - **On Complete:** Completes the error handling and data enrichment process.

2. **Data Transformation for Error Inputs**
   - **Purpose:** Transforms and augments the error-related data readying it for logging or further diagnostics.
   - **Input Data Structure:**
     - Enrichment Type: Reputation
     - Enrichment Provider: Derived from inputs.error_provider
     - Other relevant enrichment and error attributes.
   - **Process Flow:**
     - Execute JSON data transformations using provided and computed data fields.
     - Configure output as enriched error data.

### Overall Process Flow
- Start with the initialization of the component upon a trigger (not specified in the YAML provided).
- Proceed to execute the **Error Enrichment** action:
  - If successful, continue to the data transformation phase to handle and transform the error data.
  - If an error occurs, handle according to predefined failure protocols (not specified).
- Utilize transformed data either to retry actions, log for diagnostics, or use as inputs for other systems/components.
- Component execution completes after handling all transformations and error enrichments, providing output data or status indicating the session management's success or failure.
