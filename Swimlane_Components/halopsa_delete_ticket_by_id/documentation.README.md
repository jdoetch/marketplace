# Technical Documentation for HaloPSA - Delete Ticket by ID

## Overview
The HaloPSA - Delete Ticket by ID component is designed for automated ticket management within the HaloPSA system, specifically for the deletion of tickets by their unique ID. This process streamlines operations and ensures a secure and controlled method of ticket deletion directly tied into the HaloPSA API, characterized by a high level of automation compatibility with existing ITSM systems.

## Process Flow

1. **Initialization**: The component is triggered by a specific event or condition that necessitates the deletion of a ticket.
2. **Action Execution**: The core action is the `halopsa.delete_ticket_by_id`, which interfaces with the HaloPSA system.
3. **Parameter Handling**:
    - **Ticket ID**: The unique identifier of the ticket to be deleted is required as an input. It is passed as a path parameter.
    - **Deletion Reason**: An optional reason for the ticket deletion can be provided as a parameter.
4. **Execution Conditions**:
    - **Success**: If the deletion is successful, subsequent steps or notifications might be triggered as defined in the configuration.
    - **Failure**: On failure to delete the ticket, appropriate error handling or retry logic will be engaged.
5. **Completion**: On successfully deleting a ticket, the action may mark the end of the particular workflow or trigger further actions defined in the component.
