#### Retrieve a User
- **Inputs**: User Account details are required.
- **Outputs**: Obtains detailed user information from Okta necessary for subsequent steps.

#### User Retrieval Check
- **Conditions Evaluated**: Success is determined by the presence of a legitimate status code from the user retrieval action.

#### Transform User Data
- **Data Handled**: Receives user information and extracts the user ID.
- **Outcome**: Provides user ID for session revocation.

#### Revoke All User Sessions
- **Operation**: Calls the Okta API endpoint to revoke sessions.
- **Criticality**: Ensures user session security by preventing unauthorized session continuation.

#### Check Revocation Success
- **Evaluation**: Determines the success of the revocation process by reading return status codes.
- **Result Handling**: Finalizes the process by setting the outcome status which can be used for audit or notification purposes.

## Conclusion
The `Okta - Revoke All User Sessions` component automates the process of revoking user sessions, which is critical for maintaining security and compliance in enterprise systems.
