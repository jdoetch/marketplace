# Cloudflare_Remove Member Component Documentation

## Overview
The Cloudflare_Remove Member component is designed to facilitate the secure and automated removal of members from Cloudflare accounts. This document provides a comprehensive overview of the component, its capabilities, and the sequence of actions performed during the removal process.

## Purpose
The primary reason for the existence of the Cloudflare_Remove Member flow is to enhance security and manageability by allowing administrators to programmatically remove users from an organizationâ€™s Cloudflare account. This capability is crucial for maintaining operational security and compliance, especially when managing user access dynamically.

## Component Summary
The Cloudflare_Remove Member component automates the process of removing a member through a set HTTP API request to Cloudflare, handling various potential states such as active, fail, queued, and success. This ensures that the process conforms to expected security standards and behavior, reducing the manual overhead and error potential.

## Process Description
### Action: Remove_Member
- **Type**: HTTP
- **Description**: This action facilitates the removal of a member by executing a pre-configured HTTP request to the Cloudflare API.
- **Inputs**:
  - **Endpoint**: `https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/members/{member_id}`
  - **Headers**:
    - **Auth-Email**: User's authentication email.
    - **Auth-Key**: Corresponding authentication key.
- **Settings**:
  - **Follow Redirects**: True
  - **Verify Certificates**: True

### Execution Flow
1. **Action Initialization**: Begins with configuring the HTTP request headers and parameters.
2. **Perform API Request**:
   - On successful execution, the action transitions to a 'success' state.
   - On failure, the action transitions to a 'fail' state.
3. **Completion**:
   - On successful removal: The component confirms the member's removal and logs the action.
   - On failure: The component logs the error and may retry or escalate according to predefined rules.

## Process Outcomes
- **On-Success**: Member is successfully removed, and appropriate success confirmation is logged.
- **On-Failure**: Errors are logged and handled according to failure management protocols.

## Overall Process Flow Summary
The overall process begins with initializing the removal action, making the HTTP request to the Cloudflare API, and handling the response to determine the next steps based on the outcome (success or failure). The decision points and outcomes ensure that the action adheres to defined protocols and security standards.
