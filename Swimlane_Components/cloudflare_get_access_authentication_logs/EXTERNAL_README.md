The "Cloudflare Get Access Authentication Logs" component facilitates the automated retrieval of authentication logs from Cloudflare accounts, enhancing security oversight and compliance management. This is achieved through an HTTP action designed to fetch comprehensive log details, supporting continuous monitoring and evaluation of authentication-related events in the userâ€™s Cloudflare settings.
