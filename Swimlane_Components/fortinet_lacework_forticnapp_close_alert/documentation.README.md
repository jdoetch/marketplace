# Technical Documentation: Lacework FortiCNAPP - Close Alert

## Overview
The "Lacework FortiCNAPP - Close Alert" component is designed to provide a structured and automated response to alerts generated within a Lacework cloud environment. This component integrates with FortiCNAPP, enhancing security incident response capabilities. The automation of responses is aimed at increasing the efficiency of alert management and ensuring timely intervention.

## Summary of the Component
The component operates by triggering specific actions based on the alert statuses such as active, queued, failed, or success. The component is defined within a YAML configuration, employing actions and connectors specifically designed for interaction with Lacework and potentially other integrated services.

## Process Flow
### 1. Initiation
The process begins when an alert condition is met in Lacework, invoking the component from its entry point, which manages action responses.

### 2. Action Responses
- **Action Response**: This action is initiated by creating variables essential for further steps in the response process. This action sets the pathway to either success or failure in handling the alert.
- **On-success**: Moves to the "Close Alert" action, representing the transition to attempt closing the alert.
- **On-failure**: There are no subsequent actions defined in this pathway in the provided YAML, suggesting the cessation of the component process.

### 3. Close Alert (Connector Action)
- **Purpose**: The main task of this action is to interact with Lacework to close an alert based on the provided alert ID, comment, and reason.
- **On-success**: Transition to a successful response is made, indicating the alert has been effectively closed.
- **On-failure**: Transition to a failure response, which involves logging or notifying that the alert closure attempt did not succeed.

### 4. Final Responses
- **Successful Response**: Updates variables indicating a successful operation. The response includes a confirmation message detailing the success of the closure.
- **Failure Response**: Updates variables to reflect the failure state, providing detailed error messages to assist debugging efforts.

## Overall Process Flow Summary
This component serves as an automated resolution path for closing alerts generated by Lacework. Upon activation, it attempts to close the alert using the "Close Alert" action. Depending on the outcome of this action, it appropriately updates the system status and logs all pertinent outcomes, thus ensuring accurate tracking of incident response activities.
