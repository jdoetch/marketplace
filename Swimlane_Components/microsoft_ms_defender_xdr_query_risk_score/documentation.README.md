# MS Defender - Query Risk Score Component Documentation

## Overview
This document provides technical documentation for the "MS Defender - Query Risk Score" component. The goal of this flow is to automate the process of querying and transforming risk score data from Microsoft Defender, helping organizations to efficiently assess and respond to security risks.

## Summary of the Component
The "MS Defender - Query Risk Score" component is structured to interact with Microsoft Defender to fetch and analyze risk score data associated with a specific asset. Through a series of actions and transformations, this component aims to simplify the monitoring of threat levels, facilitating quicker responses and assessments.

### Actions in the Flow
Below is the description and purpose of each action within the component:

1. **Query Defender Risk Score**:
   - **Type**: Connector
   - **Purpose**: Initiates the query to Microsoft Defender to fetch the risk score of an asset.
   - **Subsequent Steps**:
     - **On-Success**: Proceeds to the "Defender Status Code" action.
     - **On-Failure**: Ends the process (specific actions on failure are not described in the provided YAML).

2. **Transform Defender Risk Score**:
   - **Type**: Transformation
   - **Purpose**: Transforms the fetched risk score data into a structured format for analysis.
   - **Subsequent Steps**:
     - **On-Success**: Continues to "Defender Risk Score High" conditional action.
     - **On-Failure**: Ends the process.

3. **Defender Status Code**:
   - **Type**: Conditional
   - **Purpose**: Checks the status code returned from the Defender API to determine the next steps.
   - **Subsequent Steps**:
     - **On-Success**: Processes depending on conditions defined.
     - **Else**: Executes the "No Defender Status Code" transformation.

4. **Defender Risk Score High**:
   - **Type**: Conditional
   - **Purpose**: Assesses if the risk score indicates a high threat level.
   - **Subsequent Steps**:
     - **Else**: Proceeds to "Low/Medium Risk Score".

### Overall Process Flow Summary
The flow starts with the "Query Defender Risk Score" action and, based on the response, either progresses through a series of transformations and conditions or stops if any action fails. The process is designed to categorically assess risk scores and log details of high-risk findings. Actions include conditional checks and transformations to ensure accurate and efficient data handling.

## Reason for the Flow
This component is essential for organizations utilizing Microsoft Defender, providing an automated approach to query, analyze, and respond to potential risks based on the risk scores. It helps in proactive security management and ensures that potential threats are managed swiftly and efficiently.
