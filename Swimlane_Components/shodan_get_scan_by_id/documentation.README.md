# Documentation for Shodan - Get Scan by ID Component

## Overview
The "Shodan - Get Scan by ID" component is designed to retrieve detailed information from Shodan concerning a specific scan based on its ID. This technical documentation covers the setup, operations, and the step-by-step flow of this component ensuring ease of integration and usage.

### Summary of the Component
This component provides functionalities targeted at enriching security and network automation by querying the Shodan database directly via API calls. It fetches details of a specific scan using its unique identifier, integrating these results into other systems or workflows for further analysis.

### Detailed Process Flow

1. **Get Scan by ID**
   - **Purpose:** Fetches the data associated with a specific Shodan scan ID.
   - **Type:** HTTP request
   - **On Success:** Initiates the 'Create Enrichment' action.
   - **On Failure:** Triggers the 'Normalize Create Error' action.
   - **Endpoints:**
     - Uses the `GET` method to retrieve scan data from `https://api.shodan.io/shodan/scan/{scan_id}`.
     - Input includes the `scan_id` path variable.
   - **Post Action:** Evaluates success or failure and proceeds accordingly.

2. **Create Variables**
   - **Purpose:** Prepares variables for use in subsequent actions.
   - **Type:** Local variable setting
   - **On Success:** Calls 'Shodan - Get Scan by ID'
   - **On Failure:** None
   - **Variables Created:**
     - `result` capturing the output from the 'Get Scan' action.

3. **Create Enrichment**
   - **Purpose:** Transforms data from 'Get Scan by ID' into a standardized format for further processing.
   - **Type:** Data transformation
   - **On Success:** Leads to 'Update Enrichment'.
   - **On Failure:** None
   - **Data Handled:** Results from the previous 'Get Scan by ID' captured and reformatted into an 'enrichment' structure.

4. **Update Enrichment**
   - **Purpose:** Updates existing systems or databases with the new, enriched data set.
   - **Type:** Database or API update
   - **On Success:** None
   - **On Failure:** None

5. **Normalize Create Error**
   - **Purpose:** Handles errors that may occur during the 'Get Scan by ID' action.
   - **Type:** Error handling
   - **On Success:** Transitions to 'Update Enrichment' with error details.
   - **On Failure:** None
   - **Details:** Traps error codes and messages, preparing them for logging or notification processes.

### Overall Process Flow Summary
The component initiates by setting variables, which are then used to perform a Shodan scan retrieval based on ID. Upon successful retrieval, the data undergoes enrichment and transformation before being updated in a system or database. Any errors encountered during the retrieval phase are normalized and redirected for error handling procedures.

This flow ensures that data extracted and transformed is accurate, formatted appropriately, and errors are managed effectively throughout the process, maintaining the integrity and reliability of the system.
