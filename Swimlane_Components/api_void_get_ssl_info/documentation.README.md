# API Void - Get SSL Info Component Documentation

## Overview
The API Void - Get SSL Info component is designed to obtain detailed SSL information and certificates from various domains using API Void's SSL Info services. This component is essential for ensuring secure communications by verifying the SSL certificates and enhancing cybersecurity measures.

## Summary of the Component
API Void - Get SSL Info component, as part of an automation process, interacts with API Void services to retrieve and process SSL certificate data. It provides functionalities such as creating variable instances, updating enrichment details, executing HTTP requests, and handling data transformations related to SSL information retrieval.

## Process Flow
1. **Initiate Request**:
   - Start with an HTTP request to the API Void's SSL info endpoint.
   - On success, proceed to create enrichment.
   - On failure, normalize and report the error.

2. **Create Enrichment**:
   - Transform the incoming data to structure the SSL information.
   - Upon successful transformation, update the enrichment details.
   - If transformation fails, proceed to error normalization.

3. **Update Enrichment**:
   - Variables created from SSL information are updated for use in downstream processes or integrations.
   - This step is crucial for keeping enrichment data relevant and accurate.

4. **Normalize and Handle Errors**:
   - Any error in the process is normalized to standardize error reporting across systems.
   - This step ensures that error handling is consistent and informative.

5. **Complete Process**:
   - The component finalizes the process by updating systems with the new or modified SSL information.
   - This step confirms the success or failure of the entire operation, triggering appropriate notifications or actions based on the outcome.

## Detailed Action Description

### HTTP Request (`_request`)
- **Type**: HTTP
- **Purpose**: Initiates a request to retrieve SSL information from a specified endpoint.
- **Subsequent Steps**:
  - **On Success**: Triggers `Create Enrichment`.
  - **On Failure**: Triggers `Normalize Error`.

### Create Variables (`create_variables`)
- **Type**: Create Variables
- **Purpose**: Initializes variables required for processing and storing SSL data.
- **Subsequent Steps**:
  - **On Success**: Triggers subsequent HTTP request or data processing.
  - **On Failure**: Proceeds to error normalization.

### Update Enrichment (`update_enrichment`)
- **Type**: Update Variables
- **Purpose**: Updates the enrichment data with the latest SSL info, ensuring data accuracy and relevance.
- **Subsequent Steps**:
  - **On Success**: Completes the enrichment update, leading to process finalization.
  - **On Failure**: Error normalization.

### Create Enrichment (`create_enrichment`)
- **Type**: Transformation
- **Purpose**: Structures the raw SSL data into a more usable format, enriching the data repository.
- **Subsequent Steps**:
  - **On Success**: Updates the enrichment details.
  - **On Failure**: Moves to error handling.

### Normalize Error (`normalize_error`)
- **Type**: Connector
- **Purpose**: Standardizes error output for consistency across system reporting.
- **Subsequent Steps**:
  - **On Completion**: Logs error and may trigger alerts or notifications based on the error severity and context.

## Overall Process Flow Summary
The component "API Void - Get SSL Info" is a crucial automation task that manages the retrieval and processing of SSL certificates information, facilitating enhanced security posture and streamlined data enrichment processes in cybersecurity operations.
