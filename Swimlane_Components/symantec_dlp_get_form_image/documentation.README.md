  - **Message ID** - Reference to message ID
  - **Violation ID** - Reference to violation ID
  - **Verify SSL** - Boolean flag to verify SSL certificate

- **Success Flow:** On success, triggers no further actions directly but prepares data for potential processing or review.

- **Failure Flow:** No subsequent action is triggered on failure, but error handling measures should be in place to log or alert system administrators.

- **Completion Handling:** Component Result action is prepared to handle the results after completion of Get Form Image.

#### 2. Component Result
**Type:** Transformation
**Description:** This action handles the result from the Get Form Image action, transforming data outputs or error messages as per defined specifications.

- **Transformation:**
  - **Result** - A critical evaluation on whether an action succeeded or failed, presenting processed results or failure messages accordingly.

- **Success Flow:** No further action.

- **Failure Flow:** No further action.

- **Completion Handling:** This marks the end of the component's execution, optionally pushing results to a destination or logging outcomes.

## Overall Process Flow

The execution of this component begins with the Get Form Image action, which upon completion, either successfully retrieves the image or fails and handles the error. Subsequently, the output or error is transformed by the Component Result action for final processing or review.
