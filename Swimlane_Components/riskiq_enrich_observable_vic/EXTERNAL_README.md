Swimlane Turbine components are standardized and modular automation building blocks that can be used and re-used across all of your applicable automation use cases.

This RiskIQ Enrich Observable VIC component takes incidents or raw security observables with additional context, metadata and other relevant intelligence from RiskIQ Enrich Observable VIC enrichment. This component integrates with Swimlane's Turbine Extendable Data Schema. This common data model allows security practitioners to standardize data across many security tools for common security events, enrichments and remediations in Swimlane's Turbine platform.

This component empowers security teams to automate and enrich threat intelligence, streamlining investigations and bolstering defense mechanisms.
