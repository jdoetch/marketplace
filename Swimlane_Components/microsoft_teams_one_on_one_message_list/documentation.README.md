# Microsoft Teams - Refresh One on One Message List Documentation

## Overview
The Microsoft Teams - Refresh One on One Message List component aims to efficiently manage and refresh message lists in personal chat scenarios on the Microsoft Teams platform. It is designed specifically to enhance automation and real-time update capabilities, making it highly relevant for applications demanding dynamic message management and interaction.

## Component Summary
This component comprehensively manages the workflow of updating and validating messages within a one-on-one chat in Microsoft Teams. Using a combination of conditional logic, data transformations, and integrations with Microsoft Teams API, it ensures that message lists are current and accurately represent the chat's state.

### Process Flow Summary
1. **Input Validation**: Ensures correct inputs are provided for further actions in the flow.
2. **Message Listing**: Queries Microsoft Teams for the latest messages via API.
3. **Error Handling**: Implements robust error handling throughout the sequence to manage exceptions and ensure flow continuity.
4. **Output Preparation & Transformation**: Formats the retrieved data for output readiness.
5. **Result Updating**: Outputs are prepared and stored back to designate storage or variable for further use.

### Detailed Actions Description

#### Input Validation
- **Type**: Conditional
- **Description**: Validates the chat ID and Teams user inputs to ensure non-null and valid formats before proceeding.
- **On Success**: Moves to fetch messages.
- **On Failure**: Moves to the input validation error handling procedure. 

#### List Messages in a Chat (Microsoft Teams Connector)

- **Description**: Connects to Microsoft Teams to retrieve a list of messages in the specified chat.
- **On Success**: Proceeds to prepare output with received messages.
- **On Failure**: Triggers custom error handling actions to record and address the fetching error.

#### Prepare Output
- **Type**: Transformation
- **Description**: Transforms the structure of messages to a specified format that suits the output requirement.
- **On Success**: Updates the action result variable with transformed results.
- **On Failure**: Executes error-specific procedures.

#### Action Error Handling
- **Type**: Variable Update
- **Description**: Handles errors by updating variables tied to error states and contents, thereby tracking reason for failure.
- **On Success**: Links to subsequent conditional operations or ends the flow if no other actions.

#### Update Result Variable
- **Type**: Variable Update
- **Description**: Updates a variable to store the transformed results that will be used as the final component output.
- **On Success**: Typically, this would end the process flow or can trigger another sequence of actions depending on the setup.
- **On Failure**: Handles exceptions or logs for the failed update.
