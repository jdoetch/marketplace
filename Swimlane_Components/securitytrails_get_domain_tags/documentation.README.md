# Documentation: SecurityTrails - Get Domain Tags

## Overview
The "SecurityTrails - Get Domain Tags" component is designed specifically to collect and provide domain-related tags from SecurityTrails, which is a leader in domain and DNS-based data intelligence. This documentation provides a detailed technical description, flow, and actions within the component.

## Component Summary
The purpose of this component is to enable users to automatically retrieve and process domain tags from SecurityTrails. This automates the process of fetching key data points for security and domain management.

### Actions Description
**Action: Error Enrichment**
- **Type:** Transformation
- **Purpose:** This action handles errors during data fetching by enriching the error information with additional details such as type, provider, and timestamp.
- **Subsequent Steps:**
  - **On Success:** Proceeds to the next step as planned in the process flow.
  - **On Failure:** Triggers error handling mechanisms to manage the failure appropriately.

#### Inputs
- **Error Provider:** Identifies the provider of the error.
- **Error Status:** Status code of the error.
- **Error Result:** Detailed message or data about the error.

#### Transformations
- Enriches error information with properties including the reputation, provider, verdict, timestamp, permalink, content, and raw data.

### Overall Process Flow
1. **Start:** Triggered by an external event or scheduled task.
2. **Perform Enrichment:** The initial step of the process where error handling and enrichment occur.
3. **Decision Making:** Based on the success or failure of the enrichment, the process will either move forward to collect domain tags or handle the error if enrichment fails.
4. **Complete:** The process terminates after handling the error or successfully completing the enrichment and retrieval of data.

### Error Handling
In the event of an error during data enrichment:
- An enriched error record is created, providing visibility into the failure mechanism.
- Appropriate notifications or alerts can be triggered, depending on the system configuration.

## Conclusion
This component is crucial for users needing efficient error handling and data enrichment during interactions with SecurityTrails data. Integration into larger security and domain management systems can significantly enhance automation and error management capabilities.
