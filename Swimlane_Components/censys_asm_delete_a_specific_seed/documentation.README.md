# Technical Documentation: Censys ASM - Delete a Specific Seed

## Overview
This documentation provides a comprehensive technical guide for the component "Censys ASM - Delete a Specific Seed". The purpose of this component is to enable users to efficiently manage and delete specific seeds within the Censys ASM system, ensuring accuracy and timeliness in database management and security.

## Summary of the Component
The "Censys ASM - Delete a Specific Seed" component is designed to streamline the process of deleting seeds from the Censys Asset Management (ASM) database. This action is crucial for maintaining the relevancy and efficiency of security operations, allowing users to swiftly adjust assets within their monitored environment.

## Detailed Component Actions
### Action: Error Enrichment
**Type:** Transformation

The Error Enrichment action is the core of this component, primarily aimed at processing errors that occur during the deletion of a seed.

#### Subsequent Steps:
- **On-Success:** Proceeds to finalize the component process and wrap up any loose ends, ensuring a clean exit.
- **On-Failure:** Initiates error handling procedures to attempt a recovery or log the failure for further analysis.
- **On-Complete:** Concludes the action, typically by exiting the component or transitioning to a state of rest.

### Transformation: Error Enrichment Details
- **Title:** Error Enrichment
- **Description:** Handles errors by enriching them with additional metadata such as the error provider, status, and result data.
- **Inputs:**
  - **Error Provider:** The source of the error.
  - **Error Status:** Status code or similar identifier indicating the type of error.
  - **Error Result:** Detailed description or data about the error.
- **Outputs:**
  - **Processed Error Data:** Enhanced error information suitable for further processing or logging.

## Overall Process Flow Summary
The flow of the "Censys ASM - Delete a Specific Seed" component is structured to optimize error handling and enrichment during the deletion process. Starting with the initialization of the deletion, the component handles any arising errors by enriching them and subsequently concludes the operation post-enrichment. This ensures that all errors are properly documented and addressed, maintaining the integrity and security of the database management process.

### Process Steps:
1. **Initiate Deletion:** The seed deletion process is started.
2. **Error Handling:** Any errors encountered are captured and fed into the Error Enrichment process.
3. **Error Enrichment:** Errors are enriched with additional information and processed.
4. **Completion:** The process completes with a check for success or failure, followed by appropriate handling.

This methodical approach ensures that every part of the seed deletion process is monitored and managed to prevent data inconsistency and maintain system integrity.
