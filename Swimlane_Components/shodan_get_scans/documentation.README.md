# Shodan - Get Scans Component Documentation

## Overview
The "Shodan - Get Scans" component is designed to interact with Shodan, a search engine for Internet-connected devices, to execute and handle the results of network scans. This technical documentation outlines the functionalities, actions, input and output schemas involved in the component.

### Short Description
The "Shodan - Get Scans" component automates the retrieval of scan results from Shodan, ensuring efficient analysis and handling of network data. This component plays a crucial role in cyber security and network management by allowing users to automate Shodan scans and process their outcomes.

## Process Flow Summary
The component includes multiple actions that guide data through transformation, querying Shodan, handling potential errors, and updating enrichment data. The flow is as follows:
1. Retrieve scan results from Shodan.
2. On success, process the data for enrichment.
3. On failure, handle errors and normalize data.
4. Update enriched data stakes based on the processed information.

### Actions Descriptions
#### 1. **Shodan Get Scans**
  - **Type:** HTTP Request
  - **Purpose:** Retrieves current scan data from Shodan.
  - **On-Success:** Proceed to create enrichment.
  - **On-Failure:** Trigger error normalization.
  - **Inputs:** API endpoint details and query parameters.
  - **Outputs:** Scan results including status codes and data body.

#### 2. **Create Variables**
  - **Type:** Create Variables
  - **Purpose:** Initializes variables for holding intermediate data.
  - **On-Success:** Trigger Shodan Get Scans.
  - **Inputs:** None defined.
  - **Outputs:** Variables ready environment for other operations.

#### 3. **Create Enrichment**
  - **Type:** Transformation
  - **Purpose:** Constructs enrichment data from scan results.
  - **On-Success:** Update the enrichment data.
  - **Inputs:** Data from Shodan Get Scans action.
  - **Outputs:** Constructed reputation data, timestamps, and raw data snippets.

#### 4. **Update Enrichment**
  - **Type:** Update Variables
  - **Purpose:** Updates existing data structures with new enrichment data.
  - **Inputs:** Enrichment data from Create Enrichment.
  - **Outputs:** Updated enrichment records.

#### 5. **Normalize Error**
  - **Type:** Connector
  - **Purpose:** Standardizes error data and re-formats for consistent error handling.
  - **On-Success:** Update enrichment with error information.
  - **Inputs:** Error codes and messages from failed Shodan API requests.
  - **Outputs:** Normalized error data embedded in the enrichment process.

## Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs Schema Referenced:** Detailed inputs objects are referenced for each action, facilitating predefined structures based on operational requirements.
- **Output Schemas Referenced:** Output schemas for each action ensure that data is formatted and passed correctly throughout the component operations.

## Error Handling
Errors from the Shodan API or during data transformation are handled gracefully, with normalization routines and updates to enrichment datasets to reflect error states, enhancing reliability and robustness of the component.

## Usage
This component should be integrated within larger automation or monitoring solutions that require real-time data from network scans, providing critical input for security operations and network management systems.
