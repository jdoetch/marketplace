# Documentation for Bitwise Operator

## Overview
The Bitwise Operator component allows for the execution of various bitwise operations on input values. This technical documentation aims to provide end-users with comprehensive details on the Bitwise Operator's capabilities, usage, and the flow of operations within a specifically designed component.

### Purpose
The Bitwise Operator component exists to provide a secure, reliable, and efficient means of performing bitwise operations within automation workflows. Its primary functions are to support operations such as AND, OR, XOR, NOT, and bit shifts on integers provided as inputs.

### Component Summary
The Bitwise Operator component performs bitwise manipulations based on the settings configured in the input by the end user. The component runs in a restricted environment where network access and custom package imports are disallowed to ensure security and compliance.

### Actions Summary
- **Perform Bitwise**: The main action within this component. This action takes two integers (left, right) and a string (operation) denoting the type of bitwise operation to perform. Based on operation, it produces a result by applying the specified bitwise operation on left and right.

#### Details of Actions
1. **Perform Bitwise**
   - **Type**: Python
   - **Inputs**: 
     - left: Integer - Left component of bitwise operation.
     - right: Integer - Right component of bitwise operation.
     - operation: String - Type of operation to perform (AND, OR, XOR, NOT, Bit Shifts).
   - **Outputs**: The result of the bitwise operation.
   - **Success and Failure**: 
     - **On Success**: Proceeds to complete the action and return the result.
     - **On Failure**: Triggers error handling by reporting an invalid operation or input type error.

### Process Flow
1. **Initialization**: Input parameters left, right, and operation are received.
2. **Validation**: Checks the validity of the input types and the operation requested.
3. **Execution**: Based on the operation parameter, the appropriate bitwise operation is performed.
4. **Result Handling**:
   - If the operation is successful, outputs the result.
   - If there is an error (invalid operation or issues with input types), an error message is generated and the operation is halted.

### Overall Component Structure
- **Entry Points**: Perform Bitwise action, triggered when inputs are provided.
- **Inputs**:
  - **Type**: Object
  - **Required**: left, right, operation
- **Outputs**: Result of the bitwise operation.
- **Error Handling**: Errors are managed based on input validation and execution failures, ensuring robust operation under varied conditions.

## Benefits
The Bitwise Operator facilitates the direct manipulation of number bits for logical operations, essential in digital communication, cryptography, and performance-enhancement tasks in computing environments.
