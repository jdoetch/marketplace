# Censys - Add Tag to Certificate: Technical Documentation

## Overview
The "Censys - Add Tag to Certificate" component within an automation workflow serves a critical function by categorizing and tagging certificates based on specific criteria derived from the business logic. This assists in streamlining certificate management and enhancing security posture by enabling better identification and classification of certificates.

## Summary of the Component
The component is strategically designed to interface seamlessly with Censys, a digital asset management service, to append descriptive tags to identified certificates. This process aids in the organization, searchability, and management of digital certificates in large infrastructures.

## Detailed Process Flow
### Action: Error Enrichment
- **Type:** Transformation
- **Purpose:** This action enriches the certificates with tags that specify error details in case of failures during automation tasks. It aids in troubleshooting and maintaining the health of the digital asset ecosystem.
- **On-Success:** Proceed with further processing if tagging was successful.
- **On-Failure:** Capture failure details and halt the process, sending notifications if configured.
- **On-Complete:** Conclude the enrichment phase and proceed to either route the output for further actions or end the process based on the workflow configuration.

#### Sub-Actions within Error Enrichment
- **Transformation: Ted's Error Enrichment**
  - **Inputs:** 
    - Error Provider: Indicates the source of the error.
    - Error Status: Describes the status of the error.
    - Error Result: Contains the result or output of the error incident.
  - **Process:** Based on the inputs, the error is categorized, and a corresponding tag is generated and appended to the certificate.

### Global Settings
- **Entry Point:** Initiation of the error enrichment procedure.
- **Timeouts and Delays:** Managed to ensure timely processing and response within acceptable operational thresholds.

## Overall Process Flow Summary
1. **Initiation:** The process begins at the error enrichment action, which is designed to handle and tag certificates based on error data.
2. **Error Handling:** Depending on the nature of the input and subsequent analysis, appropriate tags are generated and appended.
3. **Completion:** Post error-handling, the process either escalates for further actions or concludes based on predefined rules and outcomes.

This component ensures that all digital certificates passing through the automation pipeline are correctly tagged with relevant error information, thereby enhancing troubleshooting capabilities and operational efficiency.
