# Censys ASM - Get Risk Type by ID Component Documentation

## Overview
The component "Censys ASM - Get Risk Type by ID" aims to provide real-time security risk type information via API requests from Censys ASM platform. Its purpose is to integrate with security systems to enhance data enrichment through a detailed risk assessment and related actions.

## Component Summary
This component manages the interaction between the userâ€™s security platform and the Censys ASM to retrieve specific risk type data. It processes inputs, handles errors, and provides responses based on the information gathered from the Censys API.

## Process Flow
1. **Create Variables**: Initializes the variables required for processing the API requests.
2. **Make API Request**: Executes the HTTP request to fetch the risk type details based on the provided ID through the Censys ASM API.
3. **Create Enrichment**: Transforms the API response into a user-friendly format and handles data enrichment.
4. **Update Enrichment**: Updates the transformed data, readying it for further usage or processing.
5. **Normalize Error Data**: In cases of API errors, this step normalizes the error data into a consistent format for error handling purposes.
6. **Decision Points**:
   - If the API request is successful, proceed to data enrichment.
   - If the API request fails, perform error normalization.

## Detailed Actions
- **Create Variables**:
  - Type: Variable Creation
  - Description: Initiate all variables necessary for the process.
  - Success Path: Proceed to API request.
  - Failure Path: End the process.
