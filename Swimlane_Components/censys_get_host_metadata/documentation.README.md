# Censys - Get Metadata From Host Component Documentation

## Overview
The **Censys - Get Metadata From Host Component** is designed to streamline the process of retrieving and managing metadata from hosts using the Censys platform. This component is crucial for enhancing cybersecurity measures by providing detailed insight into the security posture of networked hosts.

### Purpose
The component aims to automate the extraction of host metadata through Censys, facilitating rapid retrieval and analysis to assist in security assessments and monitoring.

### Process Flow Summary
The component follows a structured flow to ensure robust handling and consistent results: 

1. **Initialization**: Create necessary variables to handle the metadata.
2. **Metadata Retrieval**: Connect to the Censys platform and fetch metadata from the specified host.
3. **Data Enrichment**: Analyze the fetched metadata to create a detailed enrichment report.
4. **Handle Errors**: In case of retrieval failures, normalize errors and initiate error handling routines.
5. **Update Data**: Update the enrichment system with the newly processed data.

### Detailed Actions Description

#### Create Variables
- **Type**: Variable Creation
- **Purpose**: Initializes required variables for the process.
- **On-Success**: Proceed to fetch metadata.
- **On-Failure**: Not applicable; this is a preliminary setup action.

#### Get Metadata from Host
- **Type**: Connector to Censys
- **Purpose**: Fetches host metadata from the Censys platform.
- **On-Success**: Move to data enrichment.
- **On-Failure**: Trigger error normalization and handling.

#### Create Enrichment
- **Type**: Data Transformation
- **Purpose**: Transforms raw metadata into a structured enrichment report.
- **On-Success**: Updates the enrichment database with the new information.
- **On-Failure**: Generally does not fail unless process flow is interrupted.

#### Normalize Error Data
- **Type**: Error Handling Connector
- **Purpose**: Standardizes error output for consistent handling.
- **On-Success**: Attempts to re-fetch or update metadata based on error handling logic.

#### Update Enrichment
- **Type**: Variable Update
- **Purpose**: Saves the enriched data back to the system, updating the central repository or triggering alerts as configured.
- **On-Success**: Completes the component run, often leading to data review or further analytics.

## Conclusion
**Censys - Get Metadata From Host Component** is integral to cybersecurity defenses, providing essentials for proactive security posture management. Its automation capabilities ensure timely responses to host changes and potential threats detected through metadata analysis.
