The "Censys ASM - Rescan Risk Instance" component is designed for interfacing with the Censys ASM platform via API to initiate and manage re-scans of identified risk incidents. This component ensures that the risk status of identified instances is up to date, leveraging automated and conditional sequences for efficient security data management. The structure of this component allows for dynamic response based on the success or failure of API interactions, making it integral for continuous risk monitoring.
