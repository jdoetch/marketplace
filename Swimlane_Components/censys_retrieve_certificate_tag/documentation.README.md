# Censys - Retrieve Tag for Certificate

## Overview

The Censys - Retrieve Tag for Certificate component forms a critical part of security automation, specifically designed to leverage the capabilities of Censys for enhanced certificate analysis. This component accesses Censys's APIs to retrieve tags associated with a specific certificate, aiding in the categorization and risk assessment tasks. 

## Component Summary

This component processes tasks systematically through a flow involving multiple actions, each designed to address specific operational needs. It initiates by making an HTTP request to Censys's API to fetch tags for a given certificate. Depending on the response of this action, the component either progresses to additional data enrichment steps or handles errors through a predefined error normalization process. Hereâ€™s an outline of each action within this component:

### Actions

1. **HTTP Request**
   - **Type**: HTTP Action
   - **Purpose**: To fetch the tag for a specified certificate from Censys.
   - **On-Success**: Proceed to create enrichment data.
   - **On-Failure**: Execute error normalization routine.

2. **Create Enrichment**
   - **Type**: Transformation
   - **Purpose**: Uses the data from the HTTP Request to create enriched data fields.
   - **On-Success**: Update the enrichment information.
   - **On-Failure**: None specified, typically, it would log an error or revert certain changes.

3. **Update Enrichment**
   - **Type**: Update Variables
   - **Purpose**: To update the enrichment values based on transformation outcomes.
   - **On-Success**: End of routine.
   - **On-Failure**: None specified, typically, would involve rollback or alternate handling steps.

4. **Normalize/Create Error Data**
   - **Type**: Connector
   - **Purpose**: To normalize or log error data received from the HTTP Request when it fails.
   - **On-Success**: Proceed to update enrichment with normalized data.
   - **On-Failure**: End of routine.

Each action is compartmentalized to operate independently, though they have specific triggers based on the success or failure of their predecessors. This separation ensures clarity in operation and easier troubleshooting.

## Process Flow

- The process begins with an HTTP request to fetch data based on a certificate fingerprint.
- If the request is successful, the response triggers the creation of enrichment data.
- Following successful creation, the enrichment data is then updated.
- In case of any failures at the request phase, error data is normalized.
- Post normalization, this data can update existing enrichment to reflect error specifics.

This structured flow ensures that each stage is precisely defined and manageable, with checkpoints for successes and failures that dictate subsequent actions.

### Error Handling 

- All actions have a designated error-handling routine, although specific responses to errors are generally customized based on operational requirements.
- Normalization of errors allows systematic error logging and analysis, facilitating improvements in future interactions.

## Conclusion

The Censys - Retrieve Tag for Certificate component, through its detailed and systematic approach in interacting with the Censys API, provides critical data in an organized manner, which is paramount for informed decision-making in certificate management practices.
