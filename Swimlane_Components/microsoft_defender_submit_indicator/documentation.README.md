# Microsoft Defender - Submit Indicator Component

## Overview
The Microsoft Defender - Submit Indicator Component is designed to facilitate the automation of submitting indicators to Microsoft Defender for examination and action. This automation is crucial for enhancing security measures and ensuring rapid response to potential threats.

## Purpose
This component aids in the rapid submission of security indicators such as IP addresses, URLs, or file hashes to Microsoft Defender. By automating this process, organizations can quickly inform their defense mechanisms about potential threats, allowing for timely and effective responses.

## Process Description
1. **Submit Indicator**:
   - **Type**: Connector
   - **Purpose**: Initiates the submission process by sending indicator data to Microsoft Defender.
   - **On-Success**: Proceeds to check the status of submission.
   - **On-Failure**: Logs the error and halts execution.

2. **Defender Status Code**:
   - **Type**: Conditional
   - **Purpose**: Evaluates the response from Microsoft Defender to determine the next course of action based on the submission result.
   - **On-Success**:
     - **Success Response** (Python script executed if submission is successful):
       - Outputs "Successful Submission of Indicator", confirming the indicator was accepted.
     - **On-Failure**: Logs the error and may trigger alerts or notifications.
   - **On-Failure**:
     - **Failure Response** (Python script executed if submission fails):
       - Outputs "Failed to Submit Indicator", indicating a problem occurred during submission.

## Overall Process Flow
1. **Start**: The component is invoked with the necessary indicator data.
2. **Action**: The 'Submit Indicator' action is triggered.
3. **Decision Point**: Based on response from Microsoft Defender:
   - **Success**: Confirmation of successful submission.
   - **Failure**: Error details are handled and logged.
4. **End**: Process concludes, with system status updated based on the action outcome.

## Security and Restrictions
- The component operates under strict restrictions to ensure security:
  - No external network access is allowed during scripts execution.
  - No custom package imports are permitted in Python script actions.
  - Usage of restricted global variables (`action_inputs`, `action_outputs`, `action_error`) to manage data flow securely within the scripts.

## Benefits of Automating with Microsoft Defender - Submit Indicator Component
This component reduces response times to potential threats and integrates smoothly with existing security operations, ultimately enhancing the overall security posture.

### Entry and Validation Specifications
- **Inputs**: Must include indicator type, value, and additional descriptive data.
- **Validation**: Inputs are validated for type adherence and necessary fields are required to proceed.

## Detailed Metadata and Schema Information
- **Versioning and Updates**: Managed through metadata attributes ensuring the component is up-to-date with the latest security protocols from Microsoft Defender.
- **Sharing and Access Control**: Utilizes standard security protocols to manage access and modify controls.
