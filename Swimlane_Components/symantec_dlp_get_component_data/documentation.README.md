# Symantec DLP - Get Component Data
## Overview
The Symantec DLP - Get Component Data component is designed to enhance the capabilities of data loss prevention systems by automating data extraction relating to specific incidents. This component automates the retrieval of data in incident scenarios, ensuring efficient and swift response to potential security threats.

## Description and Purpose
This component integrates with the Symantec DLP system to fetch detailed information about incidents as specified by the user. It is primarily used to automate the data extraction process, enhancing response time and accuracy in security management practices.

### Actions
#### Get Component Data Action
- **Type:** Connector
- **Purpose:** To fetch data related to a specific incident and component within the Symantec DLP system.
- **Inputs:**
  - **ID:** Incident ID (Number)
  - **Component ID:** Component ID (Number)
  - **Verify SSL:** Boolean
- **Steps:**
  - **On-Success:** Moves to the next action if data retrieval is successful.
  - **On-Failure:** Actions to take in case of a failure in data retrieval.
  - **On-Complete:** Final steps post-data retrieval including results processing.

#### Component Result Action
- **Type:** Transformation
- **Purpose:** Processes the results fetched by the Get Component Data action, transforming them into a usable format.
- **Steps:**
  - **On-Success:** Outlines the subsequent steps if the data transformation is successful.
  - **On-Failure:** Steps to consider if the transformation fails.
  - **On-Complete:** Conclude the action after processing the results.

## Process Flow Summary
1. The **Get Component Data Action** is initiated, leading to the retrieval of specific incident data based on provided IDs.
2. On successful execution, the data is passed to the **Component Result Action** where it is processed and formatted.
3. Post transformation, the results are either moved forward for further action or stored as specified by the user setup.
4. Throughout the process, checks are in place for handling failures at each step, ensuring robust operation.

This structured approach ensures the component is effective in fast-tracking response times in incident management scenarios, enhancing the overall efficiency of the security infrastructure.
