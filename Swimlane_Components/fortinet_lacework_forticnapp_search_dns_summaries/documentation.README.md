# Lacework FortiCNAPP - Search DNS Summaries Documentation

## Overview
The Lacework FortiCNAPP - Search DNS Summaries component automates the process of querying and summarizing DNS data over specific time frames using the Lacework platform. This document outlines the detailed functionality and workflow of the component, describing each action, its purpose, and the flow of data through various conditions.

## Summary of Component
This component integrates with Lacework to pull DNS query data, allowing analysis and summarization of DNS request activities within a specified time interval. It aims to enhance monitoring and security management by automating data retrieval and processing, reducing the manual workload involved.

## Actions Description
### Search Summaries
- **Type:** Connector
- **Purpose:** Fetches DNS summaries based on filter criteria such as fqdn (fully qualified domain name) and the time frame.
- **On Success:** Proceeds to the Successful Response action.
- **On Failure:** Proceeds to the Failure Response action.
- **Inputs:**
  - Start Time
  - End Time
  - FQDN
- **Outputs:** Filtered DNS summary data as specified.

### Action Response
- **Type:** Create Variables
- **Purpose:** Initializes the action response variables.
- **On Success:** Triggers the Search Summaries action.
- **Inputs:** Initializes action_response to 'pending' status and data to empty.

### Successful Response
- **Type:** Update Variables
- **Purpose:** Updates response variables on successful execution, setting the action response to display success.
- **Inputs:** Success message and data references to Search Summaries results.
- **Outputs:** Success message and relevant DNS summary data.

### Failure Response
- **Type:** Update Variables
- **Purpose:** Handles failures during the DNS search, providing a detailed error message.
- **Inputs:** Failure reason extracted based on predefined conditions or errors encountered.
- **Outputs:** Error details regarding the failure in DNS summaries fetch.

## Process Flow Summary
The component initiates with the Action Response to set initial variables, which triggers the Search Summaries to query DNS data. Depending on the success or failure of the data fetch, it transitions to either Successful Response or Failure Response. Each of these end actions updates the system status and outputs appropriately, either forwarding the collected data for further use or logging error details for debugging purposes.

### Environment and Dependencies
This component requires access to the Lacework platform with privileges to execute queries on DNS data. It operates under a default system pool and is dependent on the correct API endpoint configuration.

### Error Handling and Timeouts
Each action includes specific timeouts and post-action triggers (either success or failure), ensuring robust error handling and optimized performance throughout the execution path.

This well-structured component allows systematic DNS data retrieval and error handling, immensely useful for IT security operations within environments employing DNS query analyses for various functionalities such as threat detection and network performance assessment.
