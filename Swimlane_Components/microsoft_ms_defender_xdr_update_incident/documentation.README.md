# MS Defender - Update Incident Component Documentation

## Overview
The "MS Defender - Update Incident" component is designed for the automated handling and updating of incidents within Microsoft Defender. This automation is crucial for maintaining high security and rapid response times, which are essential in a modern security operations environment.

## Summary of the Component
This technical document provides an in-depth review of the "MS Defender - Update Incident" component. The component includes multiple actions with specific roles ranging from updating incident status, evaluating conditions to execute these updates, and handling success or failure outcomes.

### Process Flow
1. **Update Incident**: Triggers the main action, using Microsoft Defender's capability to update an incident based on provided parameters.
   - **Type**: Connector
   - **On Success**: Proceeds to assess the status update using a conditional action.
   - **On Failure**: Triggers actions defined for handling failures.
   
2. **Defender Status Code**: A conditional action to evaluate the success of the incident update.
   - **Type**: Conditional
   - **On Success**: Executes a script to handle successful updates.
   - **On Failure**: Executes a script to handle update failures.
   
3. **Success Response**: Handles the success pathway post-update.
   - **Type**: Python
   - **Purpose**: To confirm and log the success of the incident update.
   
4. **Failure Response**: Manages the failure pathway.
   - **Type**: Python
   - **Purpose**: To log and manage failures during the incident update process.

### Overall Process Flow Summary
The component begins with an incident update action using Microsoft Defender. Depending on the update's outcome, it proceeds either to a success pathway, confirming the update, or to a failure pathway, handling any issues encountered. This dual-pathway ensures that all outcomes are appropriately managed, enhancing the reliability and effectiveness of incident handling.
