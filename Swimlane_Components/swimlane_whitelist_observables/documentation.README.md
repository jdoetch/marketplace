# Technical Documentation: Swimlane Whitelist Observable

## Overview
The Swimlane Whitelist Observable component forms a pivotal part of automation and security within IT environments. This component is designed to automate the process of whitelisting observables (data points that can be monitored in a security context, such as IPs, domains, URLs, hashes, and emails) against a predefined list. The purpose is to streamline workflows in security operations, reduce manual vetting processes, and enhance the overall response time to potential threats.

## Summary of the Component
The Swimlane Whitelist Observable component uses Python scripts to process and filter incoming data. The overarching goal is to validate observables against a trusted list and segregate those which are not whitelisted for further review or action. This automation not only ensures a faster turnaround but also helps maintain a reliable and secure IT environment by minimizing human errors.

### Actions
#### Whitelist Observables Action
- **Type**: Python
- **Purpose**: To check each input observable against a predefined whitelist and categorize them into whitelisted and non-whitelisted arrays.
- **Inputs**:
  - **observables**: An array of observable objects (including types like IP, hash values, domain names).
  - **whitelist**: An object containing arrays of whitelisted items categorized by type.
- **Outputs**:
  - **observables**: A filtered array of observables not included in the whitelist.
  - **removed_items**: An array of items that were found on the whitelist and thus not included in the primary observables output.
- **On-Success/Failure/Complete**:
  - These fields allow for further actions or notifications depending on the outcome of the script (though specifics are not detailed in the provided YAML).

### Process Flow
- **Input Validation**: Checks whether all required inputs (observables and whitelist) are present.
- **Script Execution**: Executes the script which:
  - Iterates through each observable.
  - Checks each against the whitelist.
  - Classifies observables into "whitelisted" or "new observables" based on their presence in the whitelist.
- **Output Generation**: Produces two primary outputs - observables (those not on the whitelist) and removed_items (those found on the whitelist).
- **Post-Execution**: After script execution, outputs are either passed to another component, stored, or used to trigger additional processes.

## Overall Flow Summary
The Swimlane Whitelist Observable component effectively segregates observables into whitelisted and non-whitelisted, facilitating streamlined further actions like deeper analysis or alerts on non-whitelisted entries. This helps in maintaining up-to-date and secure system standards by automating part of the security monitoring process, therefore enabling quicker responses to discrepancies.
