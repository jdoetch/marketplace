# Censys ASM - Delete a Comment from SubDomain

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the "Censys ASM - Delete a Comment from SubDomain" component. The purpose of this flow is to manage comments associated with a subdomain, specifically to delete a comment. This is crucial in contexts where user feedback or annotations need to be curated or managed over time to maintain accuracy and relevance.

## Component Summary

The component leverages actions from the automation and security tool Censys ASM to manipulate subdomain data systematically. It involves multiple actions including variable creation and management, HTTP requests, and error handling.

### Process Flow

1. **Create Variables**: Initializes necessary variables for the process.
   - **Type**: Variable Creation
   - **On Success**: Proceeds to make a HTTP request to delete a comment.
   - **On Failure/Completion**: Not explicitly defined in the schema.

2. **HTTP Request (_Request)**: Performs the HTTP DELETE operation to remove a particular comment from a subdomain.
   - **Type**: HTTP Request
   - **URL Composition**: Constructed dynamically using subdomain and comment ID inputs.
   - **On Success**: Initiates the enrichment creation based on the response.
   - **On Failure**: Handles potential errors in deletion through normalization action.

3. **Create Enrichment**: Handles data transformation based on the deletion response.
   - **Type**: Transformation
   - **On Success**: Updates enrichment details post-deletion.
   - **On Failure/Completion**: Not specified.

4. **Normalize Create Error (Normalize_CreateError_ATWC)**: Manages error handling from the deletion process.
   - **Type**: Connector
   - **Purpose**: Normalizes error data for consistent error management.
   - **On Success**: Re-attempts updating the enrichment data.

5. **Update Enrichment**: Updates the system on the result of the deletion operation.
   - **Type**: Update Variables
   - **On Success/Failure/Completion**: Not specified.

### Overall Process Flow

The component initiates with setting up essential variables, followed by executing a deletion command via a HTTP request. Depending on the outcome, it either processes the deletion confirmation or handles the error. Post processing, the system updates are made to reflect the new state after deletion.

In essence, this component automates the meticulous process of comment removal on subdomains, ensuring data integrity and operational consistency in managing domain-related annotations in the Censys ASM environment.

### Error Handling

Each critical action has associated error handling mechanisms which ensure resilient operation across the component's workflow. Proper error normalization and handling strategies are crucial for maintaining the componentâ€™s reliability and effectiveness in dynamic operational environments.

## Conclusion

The "Censys ASM - Delete a Comment from SubDomain" component is a critical tool for administrators and security operations centers relying on Censys ASM for domain management, providing automated, reliable, and error-resilient functionalities for managing subdomain comments.
