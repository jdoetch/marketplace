# Cortex - Isolate Endpoint: Technical Documentation

## Overview
The Cortex - Isolate Endpoint component is designed to enhance security operations by automating the isolation of endpoints within a network environment. This document serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding the actions and functionalities of this component.

### Summary of the Component
Cortex - Isolate Endpoint primarily focuses on endpoint security through automation. By isolating endpoints, it prevents the spread of threats and mitigates risks swiftly. This component integrates various actions and triggers to ensure efficient operational handling and security management.

### Detailed Process and Actions

#### Action: Error Enrichment
- **Type:** Transformation
- **Purpose:** The error enrichment action aims to analyze and enrich error data coming from endpoints. It transforms raw error data into a structured format that is easier to analyze and take subsequent action on.
- **Steps:**
  - **On-Success:** If the action completes successfully, it triggers further predefined success actions.
  - **On-Failure:** On failure, it triggers predefined failure handling actions.
  - **On-Complete:** This step includes clean-up or finalization processes regardless of success or failure.

#### Transformation Details
- **Name:** Error Enrichment
- **Input:** Takes error data as input.
- **Process:** The transformation process includes parsing and structuring the error data, applying specific security rules, and preparing the data for subsequent actions.
- **Outputs:** Outputs structured error insights.

### Overall Process Flow Summary

The Cortex - Isolate Endpoint component begins with the identification of anomalous or malicious activity on an endpoint. On detection, the error enrichment action is triggered, transforming and enriching error data. Based on the enrichment results, the component may decide to isolate the endpoint. The component ensures that all steps are logged for audit purposes and that appropriate actions are taken based on the success or failure of each step.

The entire process is designed to function seamlessly with minimal human intervention, relying on predefined rules and triggers to handle different scenarios effectively.

### Conclusion

The Cortex - Isolate Endpoint component is essential for organizations looking to automate and enhance their endpoint security. With its robust framework for handling errors and threats, it ensures that all network endpoints are monitored and secured against potential threats in real-time.
