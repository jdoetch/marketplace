The component consists of several actions which together create a robust process for managing file uploads, error handling, and outcome verifications.

### Process Actions Description

1. **Create Variables**
    - *Type:* Creation of required variables.
    - *Purpose:* Initializes the essential variables required for the upload process.
    - *On-success:* Advances to the Upload Site File action.
    - *On-failure:* No specific failure action defined, typically leads to process termination.

2. **Upload Site File**
    - *Type:* Connector
