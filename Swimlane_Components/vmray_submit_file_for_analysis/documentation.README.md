# Submit File for Analysis Component Documentation

## Overview

The \"Submit File for Analysis\" component is an essential part of an automation platform designed to automate the process of submitting files for analysis to a security service. This action plays a critical role in streamlining responses to potential security threats by automating file submissions and analysis, thereby reducing the manual effort and speeding up the response time.

## Summary of the Component

The component works by automating the interaction between an enterprise's IT system and a security analysis provider (vendor). Upon triggering, the component takes a file, submits it to an analysis service, and handles responses to either proceed with further actions based on the analysis results or handle exceptions if the process encounters errors. 

### Process Flow

1. **Submit File**: A file is taken from the system and is submitted to a pre-configured analysis service.
2. **Get Details**: After the file gets submitted, the component fetches details about the submission, such as job status or submission ID, to track the analysis progress.
3. **Get Job Status**: Periodically checks the status of the analysis job.
4. **Get Submission by ID**: Once the job status indicates completion, the component retrieves the analysis results using the job ID.
5. **On Success/Failure/Completion**: Based on the job's outcome, subsequent steps may involve additional actions like notifying stakeholders, retrying submission, or terminating the process.

## Detailed Actions

## Overall Process Flow Summary

Beginning with the file submission, this component systematically processes through various stages of analysis handling. Each action is integrated to ensure seamless flow from one to another, managing exceptions and decision points based on real-time statuses. This automation not only secures processes by quickly identifying threats but also enhances operational efficiency by reducing workload on the security teams.
