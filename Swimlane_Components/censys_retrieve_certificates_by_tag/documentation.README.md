## Overview
The "Censys - Retrieve Certificates by Tag" component is designed to automate the process of retrieving digital certificates associated with specific tags using Censys' API. This component is particularly useful for cybersecurity professionals and organizations looking to streamline their digital certificate management tasks.

## Summary
This component interacts with the Censys API to fetch certificates by tags, simplifying certificate tracking and monitoring. It forms part of a larger system, typically used in environments where security and data integrity are paramount.

## Actions Breakdown
### Create Variables
- **Type:** Create Variables
- **Purpose:** Initializes the necessary variables for the component.
- **On-Success:**
  - Proceed to "_Request".
- **On-Failure:**
  - End the process.

### _Request
- **Type:** HTTP
- **Purpose:** To make a HTTP request to Censys API to retrieve certificates based on provided tag.
- **Input:** Tag as endpoint URL parameter.
- **On-Success:**
  - Trigger "Create_Enrichment".
- **On-Failure:**
  - Invoke "Normalize_CreateError_atWC".

### Create_Enrichment
- **Type:** Transformation
- **Purpose:** Processes the retrieved data to form an enriched structure.
- **On-Success:**
  - Invoke "Update_Enrichment".
- **On-Failure:**
  - End the process.

### Update_Enrichment
- **Type:** Update Variables
- **Purpose:** Updates the variables with the new enriched data.
- **On-Success:**
  - End the process or cycle back for more data processing.
- **On-Failure:**
  - End the process.

### Normalize_CreateError_atWC
- **Type:** Connector
- **Purpose:** Handles any errors from the "_Request" action, normalizing them for error handling procedures.
- **On-Success:**
  - Proceed to "Update_Enrich".
- **On-Failure:**
  - End the process.

## Overall Process Flow
1. Initialize variables.
2. Make an HTTP request to Censys API to fetch certificates by a specific tag.
3. Process the retrieved data to extract and enrich the relevant information.
4. Update the system with enriched data or handle errors if the request fails.
5. The component may cycle through the enrichment update or end upon completion of tasks.

The flow ensures that digital certificates are efficiently managed and updated in system records, providing a streamlined approach for security management.
