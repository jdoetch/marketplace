## Actions and Transformations

### Action: Enrichment - Create Error

- **Type**: Transformation
- **Description**: This action is responsible for creating an error report when a domain lookup fails or encounters an issue.
- **On-Success Steps**: If this action runs successfully, further actions might depend on the on-success pathways defined in the workflow which typically could lead to error handling or logging.
- **On-Failure Steps**: On failure, the action could trigger alerts or other error-handling processes designed in the component.
- **On-Complete Steps**: Generally, cleanup or finalization actions are performed here.
- **Publish**: Outputs from this action are published to designated storage or other components for further use.
- **Transformations Involved**:
  - **Error Enrichment**: Generates a detailed error context which includes timestamps, the nature of the error, and identifiers.
  - **Fields in Transformation**:
    - Enrichment Type: Reputation
    - Enrichment Provider: Derived from inputs.error_provider
    - Enrichment Verdict: Error
    - Additional metadata about the error context from the component inputs.

## Flow Summary

1. **Initiation**: The component begins by receiving a query for a specific domain.
2. **Error Handling**: Should an error occur, the Enrichment - Create Error action is initiated.
3. **Transformation**: Error details are transformed and enriched providing a detailed context for the error encountered.
4. **Conclusion**: Depending on the success or failure, appropriate pathways in the workflow are followed (e.g., retry, error logging, alerting).

This process ensures a detailed and structured approach to error management in domain data queries, helping maintain high reliability and accuracy in the analysis workflow.
