# Tesla Schedule Software Update Component Documentation

## Overview
The Tesla Schedule Software Update component facilitates the automated scheduling of software updates for Tesla vehicles, associating with a Vendor system via HTTP requests. This component is designed to ensure seamless updates, contributing to vehicle maintenance and enhancement without end-user direct intervention.

## Detailed Flow Description
The component operates as follows:

1. **HTTP Request Execution**:
   - **Type**: HTTP
   - **Action**: Initiates a connection to the Tesla API endpoint to schedule software updates.
   - **Inputs**:
     - `vin`: The VIN of the Tesla vehicle.
     - `in_seconds`: Schedule offset in seconds.

2. **Transformation and Output Handling**:
   - **Type**: Transformation (Data handling and transformation)
   - **Purpose**: Processes API response to abstract and simplify the output data.
   - **On Success**:
     - Publishes the output data that includes various statuses like lock status, software status, charging status, and upgrade status.

## Process Flow Summary
The Tesla Schedule Software Update component operates in a sequential and conditional manner:
- Initiates the HTTP request to Tesla's API for scheduling the software update.
- On successful execution of the request, the data received undergoes a transformation process to format and extract essential information.
- Successful data handling results in updating the vehicle's software status indicators.
- At any failure at HTTP request or output handling, the error paths are activated to handle and log the error appropriately.

This component allows for automation in vehicle systems management, reducing manual interactions and enhancing the overall operational effectiveness of software management in Tesla vehicles.
