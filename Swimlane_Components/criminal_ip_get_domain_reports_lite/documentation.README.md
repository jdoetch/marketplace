# Criminal IP - Get Domain Reports Lite Component Documentation

## Overview
The Criminal IP - Get Domain Reports Lite component is an integral part of cybersecurity automation processes. Precision-engineered to facilitate real-time domain reputation assessment, this component draws on enriched data to provide conclusive domain reputation reports. Often utilized within broader security automation frameworks, its function is to streamline the identification and analysis of potentially harmful domains based on intelligence gathering and analytics transformation processes.

## Process Flow Summary
This section describes the workflow of the Criminal IP component from initiation to completion:

1. **Triggering Event**: The process begins upon receipt of data about a domain that requires reputation checking.
2. **Data Enrichment**: Leverages internal and external APIs to enrich domain data with current security intelligence.
3. **Result Transformation**: Processes the enriched data to derive actionable insights and formats these into a structured report.
4. **Outcome Handling**: Concludes the process with decision branches based on the success or failure of the data enrichment and transformation steps.

## Actions Detailed Description
### Enrichment - Create Error
- **Type**: Transformation
- **Purpose**: This action functions to generate rich, detailed error logs upon any malfunction during the domain report generation process.
- **Process Steps**:
  - **On-Success**: Proceed to further processing since the data transformation concludes without error.
  - **On-Failure**: Halt further execution and log detailed error information.
  - **On-Complete**: Final cleanup and process completions.

#### Sub-Action: TEDS Error Enrichment
