The "PagerDuty = Create Incident" component is designed to automate the process of incident management within PagerDuty systems. This component, developed by the vendor Swimlane, effectively handles the detection, logging, and notification of system anomalies, ensuring rapid response to maintain operational stability. By automating these functions, it significantly reduces the potential for error and delay commonly associated with manual incident handling.
