# PagerDuty = Create Incident Component Documentation

## Overview
The "PagerDuty = Create Incident" component is part of an automated process designed to streamline the incident creation and management within the PagerDuty system. This component plays a critical role in ensuring timely updates and management of incidents, which is crucial for maintaining operational continuity and responding effectively to issues.

### Purpose
The main purpose of this component is to automatically create and update incidents in PagerDuty based on certain triggers or conditions detected within an infrastructure or application monitoring system. This automated integration helps reduce the reaction time to emerging problems and ensures that the right information reaches the appropriate response teams without manual intervention.

## Summary of the Component
The component consists of various actions, triggers, and configurations that work together to ensure incidents are handled effectively:

### Actions
1. **bj_to_vars**
   - **Type:** Python script
   - **Description:** Converts business logic conditions into variables utilized for creating incidents.
   - **Steps:**
     - **On-Success:** Proceed to finalize incident creation.
     - **On-Failure:** Log error and halt the process.
     - **On-Complete:** Clean up and prepare for the next possible incident creation cycle.
   - **Inputs:** 
     - Script to process inputs and set outputs such as incident detailsâ€”number, title, description.
   - **Purpose:** Serves as the transformation step where incoming data is parsed and prepared for the incident creation process in PagerDuty.

### Output Generation
The result from the action is processed to generate incident details, which include metadata such as incident number, title, description, and timestamps. These details are crucial for the visibility and traceability of incidents.

### Notification and Alerts
The component is configured to provide notifications using the details generated:
- Alerts can be categorized based on severity.
- Timestamps for incident start, end, and ingest are noted and published.
- A permanent link to the incident alert is constructed for quick access from the notification.

## Overall Process Flow
The processes initiated by this component follow a straightforward flow aimed at minimizing downtime and manual errors:
1. **Trigger:** Identifies the condition or threshold breach that warrants an incident report.
2. **Action Execution (bj_to_vars):** Processes the input data and prepares variables for incident creation.
3. **Output Processing:** Uses the converted data to create a structured incident report.
4. **Notification:** Dispatches alerts and notifications with all relevant incident details to the concerned parties.
5. **Completion:** After successful reporting, the process ensures all operations are completed and resets for future triggers.

If any action fails, the system captures the error, notifies system administrators, and suspends further action until the issue is resolved.

This automatic handling ensures that all incidents are logged and managed according to the predefined protocols, thereby standardizing responses and reducing human error.
