# Criminal IP - Get Domain Scan Report

## Overview
The "Criminal IP - Get Domain Scan Report" component is designed to enhance cybersecurity measures by providing detailed scan reports on domains associated with criminal activities. This component automates the process of gathering enriched error data and domain reputation to assist in threat intelligence and rapid response implementation.

## Summary of the Component
This component functions primarily to transform input data related to domain errors into structured outputs that can be utilized for further analysis and decision-making processes. It includes actions that handle errors by enriching them with additional data before finally outputting a comprehensive domain scan report.

### Process Flow
1. **Enrichment - Create Error**: This action is the entry point of the component which initiates the error enrichment process.
   - **Type**: Transformation
   - **Description**: Processes input error data to enrich it based on the domain's reputation and other parameters.
   - **On Success**: Proceed to aggregate the enriched data.
   - **On Failure**: Log the error and terminate the process.
   - **On Complete**: Output the enriched data to the specified channel or system.
   - **Outputs**: Enriched error data including the domain's reputation, a permalink to the error details, and the timestamp of enrichment.

### Detailed Action Descriptions
- **Create Error Enrichment**
  - **Purpose**: To enhance the original error data with additional information that aids in assessing the severity and context of the domain-related error.
  - **Subsequent Steps**:
    - **On Success**: Enrichment data is prepared and made ready for analysis or reporting.
    - **On Failure**: The failure is logged, and the process can either retry or escalate depending on predefined conditions.
    - **On Complete**: Final enriched data is delivered for reporting or integrated into other security systems.

### Overall Process Flow Summary
The component starts by receiving domain error data. This data undergoes a transformation where it is enriched with additional intelligence like domain reputation. Post-enrichment, the data is either successfully forwarded for further analysis or handled according to failure protocols, ensuring every aspect of the domain scan is accounted for in risk assessments and threat reports.

## Additional Information
- **Vendor and Technology**: Utilizes modern JSONata querying and transformation techniques to process and enrich data.
- **Integration Points**: Can integrate seamlessly with various SIEM systems and other cybersecurity tools through high-configurability and defined outputs.

This component is an essential tool for organizations looking to automate aspects of their security operations center tasks, particularly in handling and analyzing domain-related threats.
