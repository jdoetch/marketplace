- **Steps**:
  - **On Success**: [Next actions or end of the flow]
  - **On Failure**: [Error handling actions]
  - **On Complete**: [Cleanup or finalizing actions]

## Process Flow Overview

The component starts by triggering the Error Enrichment action. In the process:
1. The data undergoes a transformation where error specifics are enhanced with external reputational data.
2. Depending on the transformation success or failure, respective subsequent steps are either proceeded with or the failure handling mechanism kicks in.
3. After processing, the enriched data can either be pushed to a database or reported for further action.

The seamless integration and robust handling of transformations facilitate a reliable workflow that promptly aids in security assessments and administrative tasks related to subdomain management.
