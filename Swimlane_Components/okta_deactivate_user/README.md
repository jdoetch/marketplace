The "Okta - Deactivate User" component automates the process of deactivating a user in the Okta platform. This is essential for efficiently managing user access and ensuring system security, particularly useful in instances like employee offboarding or when immediate action is required due to security concerns. The streamlined automation provided by this component guarantees that all user deactivations are handled promptly and accurately.

NOTE: When adding the API Key to the asset for Okta it requires you to add SSWS as a prefix.  More details can be found in the Okta Management link below.
