# Censys - Create New Tag Documentation

## Introduction
This technical documentation is designed for users who need comprehensive details about the "Censys - Create New Tag" component. This document will help users understand each step and action within the component flow, enhancing the understanding of its functionalities and applications in a high contrast environment suitable for dark backgrounds.

## Component Overview
The "Censys - Create New Tag" component establishes a procedure within Censys to automate the tagging process for newly identified entities. This automation component plays a crucial role by enhancing the management and categorization of assets, which helps in improving the security posture management.

## Action: Error Enrichment
- **Type: Transformation**
- **Purpose:** The aim of the Error Enrichment action is to process and enrich error data coming from various assets.
- **Description:** This action involves transforming the incoming error data by attaching additional metadata, such as enrichment type, provider, and timestamp.

### Subsequent Steps:
- **On Success:** The next steps are defined based on the playbook's context which involves further processing or logging the enriched data.
- **On Failure:** On failure, the necessary error handling or retry logic would be executed.
- **On Complete:** This finalizes the process, ensuring that all data transformations have been successfully performed and logged.

## Process Flow Summary
The component starts with the Error Enrichment action, where error data undergoes transformation. Depending on the output of this action, the process may branch into success or failure paths. On successful enrichment, further data processing activities may be undertaken. Conversely, any failure in data enrichment triggers predefined error handling mechanisms to manage and mitigate any issues effectively.

This error enrichment involves collecting detailed error information such as error type, source, and timestamp from Censys scanned assets, transforming it into a structured format useful for analytics and reporting purposes.

## Conclusion
The "Censys - Create New Tag" component is essential for automating tagging in Censys, making the asset management process more efficient and error-driven data more accessible for review and action. By automating these processes, organizations can enhance their operational efficiency and security measures.
