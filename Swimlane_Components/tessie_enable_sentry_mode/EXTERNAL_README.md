The Tesla_Enable_Sentry_Mode component is a specialized automation tool designed to enable Sentry Mode in Tesla vehicles via a series of API commands. This component is built as a configuration within the Swinlane automation platform, delineating a few specific actions such as Tessie_Enable_Entry (HTTP request action) and Set_Output (results transformation). Each step and its corresponding response direct the succeeding processes, ensuring the vehicle's Sentry Mode is activated effectively.
