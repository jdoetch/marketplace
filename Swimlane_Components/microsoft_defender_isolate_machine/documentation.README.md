# Microsoft Defender - Isolate Machine Component Documentation

## Overview
The Microsoft Defender - Isolate Machine Component is designed to automate the process of isolating a machine within an environment using Microsoft Defender. This component ensures that machines potentially compromised or requiring investigation are quickly isolated to mitigate any potential threat to the network.

## Component Summary
This component includes several actions facilitating the isolation process, ensuring both proactive and reactive measures are taken promptly. It operates based on conditions provided and acts accordingly.

### Actions Descriptions
1. **Isolate Machine**
   - **Type:** Connector
   - **Purpose:** Initiates the isolation of a specified machine.
   - **On-Success:**
     - Proceeds to check the status code received after attempting to isolate the machine.
   - **On-Failure:** Logs the failure but does not specify further steps.

2. **Defender Status Code**
   - **Type:** Conditional
   - **Purpose:** Evaluates the status code from the 'Isolate Machine' action to determine the next steps.
   - **On-Success:**
     - Executes the 'Success Response' action if the isolation is successful.
   - **On-Failure:**
     - Executes the 'Failure Response' action if the isolation failed.

3. **Success Response**
   - **Type:** Python
   - **Purpose:** Handles the success logic and outputs that the machine was successfully isolated.
   - **On-Complete:** Completes the action without any further steps.

4. **Failure Response**
   - **Type:** Python
   - **Purpose:** Handles the error logic and outputs that the machine failed to be isolated.
   - **On-Complete:** Completes the action without any further steps.

### Process Flow Summary
1. The process starts with the 'Isolate Machine' action, which attempts to isolate a selected machine using Microsoft Defender.
2. Based on the outcome of the isolation attempt, 'Defender Status Code' action checks the result:
   - If successful, the 'Success Response' action is triggered.
   - If unsuccessful, the 'Failure Response' action is triggered.
3. Depending on the status code, appropriate responses are triggered and handled, thereby concluding the workflow.

## Conclusion
The Microsoft Defender - Isolate Machine Component is pivotal for security automation, providing the necessary infrastructure to ensure rapid response to threats by isolating affected machines quickly and efficiently. This helps maintain the integrity and security of the network.
