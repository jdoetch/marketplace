# ServiceNow Incident Ingestion Component Documentation

## Introduction

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to the ServiceNow Incident Ingestion component, detailing each action, its type, purpose, and the subsequent steps upon success or failure. It aims to facilitate end users in understanding and utilizing this component effectively within their environments.

## Short Description

The ServiceNow Incident Ingestion component is designed to automate the ingestion of incidents into Turbine. This flow enhances incident response capabilities by streamlining the process, reducing manual entry errors, and accelerating the overall response time.

## Component Overview

The component lacks specific actions defined within its structure; it primarily focuses on the ingestion based on provided inputs that encompass a variety of incident-related data points, which include but are not limited to:

- Incident categories
- Incident timestamps (creation, ingestion, etc.)
- Descriptive data about the incident (title, description)
- Associated observables (IP addresses, hostnames, etc.)
- MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques

### Inputs and Data Handling

The component accepts structured data as inputs which underpins the incident details:
- **Alert Categories**: Categories of the incident.
- **Timestamps**: Various timestamps documenting the lifecycle of the incident.
- **Incident Details and Descriptions**: Detailed description and concise title.
- **Impacted Entities**: Information on impacted user names, IP addresses, and hostnames.
- **MITRE ATT&CK Information**: Tactics and techniques used in the incident.

### Process Flow

#### On-Success
1. **Incident Creation**: Upon successful data ingestion, an incident is created in ServiceNow with all the relevant details populated from the inputs.
2. **Data Mapping**: Data from the input is mapped to corresponding fields in the Turbine TEDs schema.
3. **Confirmation**: A confirmation of incident creation is sent back to the origin system.

#### On-Failure
1. **Error Logging**: Any errors encountered during the ingestion process are logged.
2. **Notification**: Notifications about the failure are sent to the designated system administrators or incident handlers.
3. **Retry Mechanism**: Optional retry logic to attempt re-ingestion depending on the error nature.

## Summary

In summary, the ServiceNow Incident Ingestion component primarily focuses on automating the process of incident ingestion into Turbine. It ensures that all relevant data about security incidents are captured accurately and efficiently, facilitating quicker incident response and resolution. This component plays a pivotal role in security operations, especially in environments where rapid response and incident tracking are crucial.

## Conclusion

This component does not include complex decision-making processes but focuses on robust and reliable data intake and incident creation based on predefined input structures. It serves as a critical integration point for security data into Turbine, ensuring that incident data flows seamlessly from detection systems into incident management frameworks.
