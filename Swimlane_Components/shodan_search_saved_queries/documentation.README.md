# Shodan - Search Saved Queries Component Documentation

## Overview
The "Shodan - Search Saved Queries" component is a specialized automation tool for use with the Shodan platform, specifically tailored for querying and analyzing saved search data. This component empowers organizations to automate complex search operations, effectively enhancing the capabilities of security teams by providing a streamlined approach to accessing saved queries.

## Summary of the Component
This component integrates seamlessly into environments that utilize Shodan, facilitating real-time data analysis and monitoring. The process flow includes scheduling, error handling, and data transformation capabilities, ensuring that users can automate their search criteria effectively and respond to outputs with predetermined actions.

## Process Description and Flow
### Initial Setup
- **Entry Point**: The component begins with the "Create Error Enrichment" action as the entry point for executing the sequence of operations.

### Actions
1. **Create Error Enrichment**
   - **Type**: Transformation
   - **Purpose**: To handle errors encountered during the search and enrichment process.
   - **Inputs**: 
     - `error_provider`: String identifier for the error source.
     - `error_result`: Details of the error result.
     - `error_status`: Status code associated with the error.
   - **Output**: Provides relevant error data, further used for diagnostics or remediation actions.
   - **Flow**:
       - **On Success**: Transition to subsequent necessary steps based on user-defined logic.
       - **On Failure**: Captures any failures in error handling, providing a feedback loop for correction.
       - **On Complete**: Ensures all tasks are completed even if prior steps fail.

### Process Flow Summary
The component starts with initializing the error handling mechanism. Upon successful execution of the first action, it transitions based on the condition and outputs of the initial task. Error data is transformed and routed appropriately, ensuring the enrichment data is correctly handled. The component's self-contained nature facilitates high reliability in error handling during the querying process in Shodan.

## Usage
- **Environment Setup**: Ensure your environment is configured to interact with Shodan APIs.
- **Configuration Requirements**: Define error handlers and success actions as per your operational requirements.
- **Execution**: Trigger the component using the provided entrypoint, monitoring the status through configured dashboards or notifications.

## Conclusion
The "Shodan - Search Saved Queries" component ensures efficient and automated analysis of saved queries on Shodan, facilitating enhanced security operations and proactive incident response within the user's infrastructure, reducing manual workload and increasing operational efficiency.
