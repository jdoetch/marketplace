The IBM QRadar VIC component facilitates streamlined alert ingestion into your Turbine workflows. Alert data retrieved
through the QRadar “Get Offenses” action is efficiently processed in a loop action, enabling field definition, 
observable parsing, and the creation of alerts in the Turbine Extendable Data Schema (TEDS).

This integration ensures that incoming QRadar alerts are normalized and enriched for enhanced analysis, enabling 
seamless orchestration and response in the Turbine platform.
