The Defender XDR Incident Ingestion component automatically ingests Microsoft Defender XDR Incidents into your Turbine platform. This component retrieves Defender XDR Incidents and their associated alerts, extracts indicators of compromise, and transforms the data into the Swimlane Turbine Extendable Data Schema for use in conjunction with other playbooks like Swimlane's SOC Solution.
