Swimlane Turbine components are standardized and modular automation building blocks that can be used and re-used across all of your applicable automation use cases.

This Microsoft Defender XDR Incident Ingestion component automatically ingests incoming Microsoft Defender XDR Incident Ingestion ingestion into your Turbine use cases for analysis, enrichment and response. This component transforms and maps incoming data to Swimlane's Turbine Extendable Data Schema. This common data model allows security practitioners to standardize data across many security tools for common security events, enrichments and remediations in Swimlane's Turbine platform.

Enhance your security operations with efficient Microsoft Defender incident management and response automation using Swimlane Turbine's integration.
