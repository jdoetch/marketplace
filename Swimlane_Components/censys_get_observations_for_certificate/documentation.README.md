# Censys - Get Observations for Certificate

## Overview
The "Censys - Get Observations for Certificate" component is designed to provide security teams with detailed observations and insights related to SSL/TLS certificates via the Censys search engine. This component facilitates the automation of certificate reconnaissance, helping organizations in identifying potential security vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.

## Detailed Component Description
This technical documentation describes the functionality, process flow, and configuration of the actions within the "Censys - Get Observations for Certificate" component. This component leverages transformation actions to process data related to SSL/TLS certificates obtained from error logs or incident reports.

### Action: Error Enrichment - Create Error
#### Type
**Transformation**

#### Purpose
The core action in this component, "Error Enrichment - Create Error", is responsible for structuring and enriching error data based on the SSL/TLS certificate observations. It transforms raw data into structured insights that facilitate streamlined incident response and decision-making processes.

#### Steps
1. **On Success**: Proceed to publish the enrichment data.
2. **On Failure**: Log the failure details for troubleshooting.
3. **On Complete**: Assess completion status and either loop back for additional processing or terminate the component execution successfully.

### Process Flow Summary
- **Start**: The process initiated when a certificate-related error is identified.
- **Data Transformation**: Using configured transformation rules, the error data is structured and enriched.
- **Decision Points**:
  - If the transformation is successful, the data is published for further use.
  - If failure occurs, it logs details and halts further actions.
- **End**: Depending on the success or failure of the action, the results are either looped for further refinement or the process ends.

### Configuration and Inputs
- **error_provider**: Source identifier of the error.
- **error_status**: Status code associated with the observed error.
- **error_result**: Detailed description or data of the observed error.

## Conclusion
The use of "Censys - Get Observations for Certificate" in automation sequences significantly aids in proactive risk management and enhances security posture by providing timely and relevant information about SSL/TLS certificate configurations and associated risks.
