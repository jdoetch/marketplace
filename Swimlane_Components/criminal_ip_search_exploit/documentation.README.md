### Actions

#### Enrichment - Create Error

- **Type:** Transformation
- **Purpose:** This action processes error information to create a detailed enrichment based on the inputted error data.
- **On-Success:** Proceed to next steps defined in the flow.
- **On-Failure:** Handle according to failure management protocols.
- **On-Complete:** Completes the enrichment process and handles clean-up or logging if necessary.

### Process Flow Summary

1. **Initiation:** Triggered by feed inputs requiring IP analysis.
2. **Error Processing:** Error data is analyzed and transformed to provide detailed insights.
3. **Enrichment Creation:** Based on the processed error data, create an enrichment entry for further analysis.
4. **Decision Points:**
   - If the error processing is successful, proceed to enrichment.
   - If failed, trigger defined fail safes and log the issue.
5. **Completion:** On successful completion, the enrichment is catalogued for further use; failure leads to retrial or exit based on protocols.

## Advantages

1. **Automation:** Streamlines the threat detection process.
2. **Integration:** Easily integrates into existing security systems.
3. **Real-Time:** Offers real-time threat analysis and resolution strategies.

## Conclusion
