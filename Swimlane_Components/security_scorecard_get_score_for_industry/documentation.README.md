## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive technical breakdown of the "SSC - Get Score for the Industry" component. It is designed as a technical guide for end-users interacting with various systems via this component, ensuring a streamlined process in gathering scores for industries. The primary reason for the existence of this flow is to automate the collection and analysis of industrial scores, providing timely and accurate data which facilitates strategic decision-making.

## Summary of the Component
The component "SSC - Get Score for the Industry" involves multiple actions aimed at fetching and processing industry-related scores. This process includes error handling mechanisms, data transformations, and integration with external services for enriched data retrieval.

## Actions Description
### Error Enrichment Action
- **Type**: Transformation
- **Purpose**: This action is tasked with handling and enriching error responses obtained during the data gathering process. The action enriches error data to provide more context and make it usable for subsequent processing or reporting.
- **Steps Involved**:
  1. **On-Success**: Continue to the next action as defined in the workflow.
  2. **On-Failure**: Trigger an alternative flow or terminate the process depending on the error severity.
  3. **On-Complete**: Typically logs the completion and may trigger notifications if configured.

## Process Flow
1. **Trigger**: The process begins when a request to gather a score for a specific industry is received.
2. **Error Enrichment**: The first action in this flow attempts to handle any errors that arise. If an error is encountered, it is enriched and formatted for better clarity.
3. **Data Transformation**: Following successful error handling, the enriched error data undergoes transformation. This could involve formatting the data into a specific schema or integrating additional data from other services.
4. **Publishing Results**: Once transformation is complete, the results are either stored for further use or published to an external system for immediate action.

In summary, the component ensures efficient error handling and data processing to support decision-making processes related to industry scoring.
