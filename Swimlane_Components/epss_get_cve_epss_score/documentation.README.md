This component simplifies the process of obtaining EPSS scores for CVEs, enabling SOC analysts to prioritize vulnerability remediation effectively. The Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS) is a data-driven framework that estimates the likelihood of a CVE being exploited in the wild. By leveraging EPSS scores, this component enhances vulnerability management by assessing exploitation likelihood, enabling risk-based prioritization when combined with asset criticality and business impact. It equips SOC analysts with enriched vulnerability data to focus on the most exploitable threats, streamlining remediation efforts.


Usage:

- Install the component

- Pass a CVE to the component to get an output of the results which contain the score
