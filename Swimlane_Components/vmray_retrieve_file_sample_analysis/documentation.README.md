# Retrieve File Sample Analysis Component Documentation

## Overview
The Retrieve File Sample Analysis component is designed for robust security analysis within automation platforms. This document encompasses a comprehensive breakdown of each action, the overall process flow, and the conditions within this component.

## Description
The Retrieve File Sample Analysis component aims to enhance security measures by analyzing file samples using various parameters and conditions. It primarily utilizes VMRay, a leading analysis tool, to manage and evaluate file attributes. The process involves several checks and transformations to derive a detailed understanding and categorization of the files based on the analysis results.

## Actions and Workflow

### 1. Conditional Checks
- **Title**: only_if_vmray_sample_id
- **Type**: Conditional
- **Description**: Determines if the incoming sample ID matches a specific VMRay sample ID.
- **Outcome**:
  - **Success**: Proceeds to retrieve the sample.
  - **Failure**: Ends the flow.

### 2. Get Sample
- **Title**: get_sample
- **Type**: Connector (VMRay)
- **Description**: Fetches the sample details based on the observable value provided.
- **Sub-actions**:
  - **On-Success**: Data transformation is invoked.
  - **On-Failure**: Flow terminates.
  - **On-Complete**: Ensures finalization steps, if any.

### 3. Data Transformation
- **Title**: transformation
- **Type**: Data Manipulation
- **Description**: Transforms the result data to provide enriched output.
- **Details**: 
  - **Enrichment Object**: Forms part of the output, consolidating data such as reputation, timestamps, and other metadata from VMRay.

### 4. Result Publication
- **Integrated Within**: Transformation and Get Sample Actions
- **Description**: Published results internally for further use or external sharing based on outcome statuses.

## Process Flow Summary
The component starts by verifying the type of the input to ensure it matches the criteria for a VMRay file sample ID. Upon successful validation, it retrieves detailed file sample from VMRay. If the file sample is retrieved successfully, it undergoes transformation where essential data is extracted, and enriched metadata is incorporated. The flow either progresses through these successful checkpoints or terminates upon encountering failures at any step.

This structured approach aids in maintaining systematic and secure file analysis within automated environments, aligning with security and operational standards.
