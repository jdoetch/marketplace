## Overview

The "Tesla" component is designed to automate and secure interactions with Tesla vehicles through a series of actions, providing a streamlined approach for controlling vehicle functionalities such as locking and charging. This documentation details each action within the component, describes the flow and purpose, and outlines the overall process.

## Component Summary

The "Tesla" component primarily consists of two actions, "set_output" and "stop_charging", both crucial for interacting with Tesla vehicles' charging and security status. These actions operate through data transformations and HTTP requests, respectively.

### Actions

#### 1. **set_output**
   - **Type**: Transformation
   - **Purpose**: This action handles transformations of output data after interfacing with vehicle APIs. It formats the output to be suitable for downstream processing or display.
   - **Steps**:
     - **On Success**: Transition to next appropriate action
     - **On Failure**: Error handling routines are triggered
     - **On Complete**: Finalize the action by publishing the result

#### 2. **stop_charging**
   - **Type**: HTTP
   - **Purpose**: Sends a command to the Tesla vehicle to stop charging. This is a direct interaction with the vehicle's onboard system via the API.
   - **Steps**:
     - **On Success**: Proceed to set the output from the vehicle response
     - **On Failure**: Execute error handling routines
     - **On Complete**: Clean up and prepare for the next command or end the flow

## Overall Process Flow

The flow beings with the "stop_charging" action, where an HTTP request is sent to the Tesla API. Depending on the response:
- **Success**: The output is redirected to the "set_output" action, where data is transformed and formatted.
- **Failure**: Error procedures are initiated. 

This component is vital for automating interactions with Tesla vehicles, enhancing operational efficiency and security within automotive management systems.
