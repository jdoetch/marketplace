The **CrowdStrikeFalcon - RTR - Execute Netstat and Return Results** component automates the process of accessing and retrieving network statistics from a CrowdStrike Falcon-managed endpoint. The workflow begins by initializing necessary variables, extracting the target host ID, validating inputs, and executing the netstat command to gather network information. The component then monitors the execution status and compiles the results. Throughout the process, it handles errors to maintain the integrity and reliability of the operation.
