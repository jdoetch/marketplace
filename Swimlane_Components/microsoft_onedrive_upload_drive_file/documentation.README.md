# Microsoft OneDrive - Upload Drive File Component Technical Documentation

## Overview
The Microsoft OneDrive - Upload Drive File Component facilitates the automation of file uploads to Microsoft OneDrive via a structured process flow. This component ensures efficient handling of files, providing automated responses based on the success or failure of the upload action.

### Short Description
This component is designed to help automate the process of uploading files to Microsoft OneDrive, allowing users to efficiently manage their data and ensure that file handling is conducted smoothly and predictably with automated follow-up actions.

## Process Flow Summary
- **Start**: The process begins with the creation of necessary variables.
- **File Upload**: It attempts to upload a file to a specified drive and folder within Microsoft OneDrive.
- **On Success**: If the file upload is successful, the process triggers an enrichment step which can add additional data or metadata based on the upload.
- **On Failure**: If the upload fails, the process branches to an error handling mechanism, aiming to normalize and detail out the error for debugging and records.
- **Completion**: On the completion of the above steps, whether successful or with errors, the final state and outcome are logged and the process ends.

### Detailed Action Descriptions

#### 1. Create Variables
- **Type**: Variable Initialization
- **Purpose**: Set up necessary variables used throughout the component.
- **On Success**: Proceed to upload the file.
- **On Failure**: Terminate the process and log an error.

#### 2. Upload Drive File
- **Type**: Connector
- **Purpose**: Upload a file to the designated folder and drive in Microsoft OneDrive.
- **Inputs**: Includes file details such as attachments, path parameters, and headers.
- **On Success**: Trigger the enrichment action.
- **On Failure**: Proceed to normalize and record the error.

#### 3. Create Enrichment
- **Type**: Transformation
- **Purpose**: Enhance the upload results with additional metadata or data transformations.
- **On Success**: Update variables with the new enriched data.
- **On Failure**: Proceed as complete without further action.

#### 4. Update Variables
- **Type**: Variables Update
- **Purpose**: Refresh the process variables with new data values derived from the enrichment step.
- **On Success or Failure**: Routine completes after updating the variables.

#### 5. Normalize Create Error
- **Type**: Connector
- **Purpose**: Normalize and detail out the error information from the failed upload attempt, ensuring clarity and actionable data.
- **On Success**: Update the error variables to reflect the normalized error state.

### Conclusion
Upon the completion of these steps, the Microsoft OneDrive - Upload Drive File Component finalizes its operation by logging the outcomes, providing either confirmation of successful upload and enrichment or details of any encountered errors. This automated handling ensures consistent data processing, saving time and reducing manual errors.
