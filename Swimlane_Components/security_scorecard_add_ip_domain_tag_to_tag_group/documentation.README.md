# SSC - Add IP Domain Tag to an IP Domain Tag Group

## Overview
The "SSC - Add IP Domain Tag to an IP Domain Tag Group" component is designed to automate the process of tagging IP domains within a specified group using the Security Scorecard platform. This automation component enhances the management of domain reputations, ensuring that the security measures and oversight are systematic and efficient.

## Summary
This component integrates with Security Scorecard to fetch and update IP domain tags effectively. By automating these tasks, it offers a streamlined approach to managing domain tags, which is critical for maintaining up-to-date security protocols.

## Actions and Flows

### 1. Create Variables
- **Type:** CreateVariables
- **Purpose:** Initializes variables required for the component operations.
- **On-Success:** Proceeds to send a request.
- **On-Failure:** Terminates the process.

### 2. Send Request
- **Type:** HTTP
- **Purpose:** Initiates a HTTP request to the Security Scorecard API to add or update IP domain tags in a certain group.
- **On-Success:** Calls the "Create Enrichment" action.
- **On-Failure:** Calls the "Normalize Create Error" action.

### 3. Create Enrichment
- **Type:** Transformation
- **Purpose:** Transforms the response data from the Security Scorecard into a structured format suitable for further processing.
- **On-Success:** Triggers the "Update Enrichment" action.
- **On-Failure:** There is no action defined after failure; theoretically, it should halt further actions.

### 4. Update Enrichment
- **Type:** UpdateVariables
- **Purpose:** Updates the enrichment data with the new structured data formed in the "Create Enrichment" action.
- **On-Success and On-Failure:** No subsequent actions defined.

### 5. Normalize Create Error
- **Type:** Connector
- **Purpose:** Handles errors that occur during the "Send Request" step, allowing for error logging and notification.
- **On-Success:** Leads back to "Update Enrichment".
- **On-Failure:** There are no subsequent actions defined.

## Endpoints Utilized
- Primary endpoint for tagging domains: `https://api.securityscorecard.io/ip-domain-tags/{tag_id}/groups/{tag_group_id}`
- Test endpoint: `https://api.securityscorecard.io/scorecard-tags`

## Overall Process Flow
1. **Initialization:** Variables necessary for the process are created.
2. **Request Handling:** An API request is sent to Security Scorecard.
3. **Data Handling:** If the request is successful, data extraction and structure are managed; if not, error normalization occurs.
4. **Data Update:** Upon successful data structuring, the enrichment data is updated.
5. **Error Handling:** Any occurring errors are normalized for proper logging.

In essence, the SSC - Add IP Domain Tag to an IP Domain Tag Group component serves the purpose of maintaining cybersecurity measures by efficiently managing IP domain tags through interaction with Security Scorecard's API, providing streamlined and automated oversight.
