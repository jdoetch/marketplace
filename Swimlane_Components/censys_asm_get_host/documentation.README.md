# Censys ASM - Get Host Component Documentation

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive analysis and documentation of the "Censys ASM - Get Host" component. This component is designed to manage and automate processes related to host asset management within the Censys ASM platform. It assists in gathering detailed information about host assets, thereby enabling users to enhance their security measures and maintain up-to-date asset inventories.

## Component Summary
The "Censys ASM - Get Host" component works by executing a specified series of actions that retrieve and process data related to host assets. This document outlines the various actions included in the component, detailing their purposes, types, and the steps that follow each action.

### Actions Overview
1. **Enrichment - Create Error**
   - **Type**: Transformation
   - **Purpose**: This action handles errors that occur during data enrichment processes. It transforms error data into a structured format that can be easily analyzed.
   - **On-Success**: Proceeds to the next action if no errors occur.
   - **On-Failure**: Tries alternative steps or terminates the process depending on the error severity.
   - **On-Complete**: Ends the action sequence and logs the results.

2. **TEDS Error Enrichment**
   - **Type**: JSONata
   - **Purpose**: Provides a detailed enrichment of the error based on predefined parameters such as error provider and error status. It also timestamps and logs the enrichment, adding a permanent link (permalink) for future reference.
   - **Input Parameters**: 
     - `enrichment_type`: Reputation
     - `enrichment_provider`: Derived from error input.
     - `enrichment_verdict`: Error
     - `enrichment_timestamp`: Current timestamp
     - `enrichment_permalink`: Error-specific permalink
     - `enrichment_content`: Status from `error_status`
     - `enrichment_raw_data`: Raw data from the `error_result`

### Overall Process Flow
1. **Start**: The process begins when an error condition is triggered within the system.
2. **Error Handling**: The "Enrichment - Create Error" action initiates, processing the error.
3. **Error Enrichment**: If the initial handling is successful, the "TEDS Error Enrichment" action enriches the error data.
4. **Completion**: Upon completing all actions, the system logs the details and results for audit and troubleshooting purposes.

This flow ensures that all necessary steps are taken to analyze and handle errors related to host management effectively, maintaining smooth operational continuity and enhancing security response capabilities.

### Conclusion
The "Censys ASM - Get Host" component is an essential part of the security and asset management framework, allowing for a structured and efficient approach to host data processing and error management.
