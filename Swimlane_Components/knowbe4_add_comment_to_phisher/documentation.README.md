# KnowBe4 - Add Comment to PhishER Component Documentation

## Overview
The "KnowBe4 - Add Comment to PhishER" component is a designed mechanism to allow system administrators or response teams to automate the process of appending comments to suspicious emails in PhishER, a platform provided by KnowBe4. This automation helps streamline the incident response actions related to phishing attempts.

## Component Summary
The component primarily consists of three actions that contribute to its functionality: createVariables, addComment, and successResponse as well as their corresponding failure responses. Each action plays a crucial role in the processing pipeline of adding a comment. The general process flow involves creating necessary variables, attempting to add a comment through a connected system, and handling the success or failure of that attempt through various responses.

### Detailed Action Descriptions

#### Create Variables
- **Type:** Create Variables
- **Purpose:** Initializes the required variables for the operation.
- **Subsequent Steps:**
  - On Success: Triggers the addComment action.
  - On Failure: Typically leads to error handling procedures.

#### Add Comment
- **Type:** Connector (KnowBe4 PhishER Connector)
- **Purpose:** Transmits the message ID and the comment content to PhishER, attempting to append the comment to a specific message.
- **Subsequent Steps:**
  - On Success: Proceeds to successResponse action.
  - On Failure: Triggers the failureResponse to manage errors.

#### Success Response
- **Type:** Python
- **Purpose:** Handles the logic and output following a successful comment addition, typically generating success status and custom messages.
- **Subsequent Steps:** Concludes the action sequence, potentially triggering notifications or logs.

### Process Flow Summary
The overall flow begins with the creation of necessary variables, followed by attempting to add a comment. Depending on the result of the addition attempt, it either ends with a success or failure response. This flow ensures that all outcomes are handled gracefully and that activity logs or notifications are generated appropriately.

## System Requirements and Setup
- **Platform Compatibility:** Must be integrated within a system that supports KnowBe4's PhishER connectors.
- **Dependencies:** Requires access rights to the PhishER API and adequate permissions to write comments.

## Usage
The component is invoked typically when a suspicious email needs tagging or commenting within PhishER. Proper API keys and permissions should be configured for operational smoothness.

## Error Handling
In the case of failures, the component's failureResponse action is prepared to log errors and provide feedback on what went wrong, ensuring that no failure mode goes unnoticed.

## Security and Compliance
All interactions with PhishER are conducted over secure connections, with attention to minimizing data exposure and adhering to the strict privacy policies of KnowBe4.
