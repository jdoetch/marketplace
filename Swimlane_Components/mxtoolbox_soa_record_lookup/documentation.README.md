# MxToolbox - SOA Record Lookup Component Documentation

## Overview
The `MxToolbox - SOA Record Lookup` component is designed to facilitate automated lookups of SOA (Start of Authority) records for specified domains. This document details the functionality, processes, and operational guide to integrate and utilize this component in a system.

### Summary of the Component
`MxToolbox - SOA Record Lookup` is a robust tool that handles DNS queries about the SOA records of a domain, which are essential for managing DNS health and configuration. The component makes use of action sequences and transformation steps to process and respond to DNS queries reliably and efficiently.

### Process Flow and Actions

#### Action: Error Enrichment
1. **Type**: Transformation
2. **Purpose**:
   - This action aims to enrich the error data received from SOA record lookup attempts, which might fail due to various reasons like network issues or incorrect domain name entries.
3. **Steps**:
   - **On-Success**: Proceed without any errors and move to data collecting step.
   - **On-Failure**: Log the specific error and terminate the process.
   - **On-Complete**: Final wrap-up steps are executed, ensuring all sessions are terminated properly.

##### Detailed Sub-Processes:
- **Transformation via `teds_error_enrichment`**:
  - Extracts and formats error data.
  - Applies a JSON transformation to prepare the error message for end-users or for logging.
  - Collects raw inputs about the error encountered during the DNS query, including:
    - Enrichment Type: Reputation
    - Enrichment Provider and Timestamp
    - Direct link to encountered error (permalink)
    - Verdict on the error based on previously recognized patterns.

### General Component Handling
- **Errors Handling**: Errors are managed by the enrichment process which formats and presents them logically.
- **Timeouts and Delays**: Handled internally to manage connection and response times effectively.
- **Data Security**: Ensures that all data processed through the component is handled securely and conforms to standard data protection policies.

### Overall Process Flow Summary
The component processes multiple layers of actions and error management strategies to ensure accurate and robust SOA record lookups. It ensures high availability and accurate results with systematic error enrichment and handling protocols.
