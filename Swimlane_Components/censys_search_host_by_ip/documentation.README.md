# Censys - Search Host by IP Documentation

## Overview

The "Censys - Search Host by IP" component is designed to allow users to perform host searches based on IP addresses using the Censys search engine. This component is essential for security analysts and network administrators who need to gather detailed information about hosts in their networks or any IP address of interest.

## Summary of the Component

"Censys - Search Host by IP" integrates with the Censys database to retrieve comprehensive details about hosts. This integration enables the automation of data gathering, enhancing security and network monitoring operations.

### Actions

The main action within this component is the transformation action, which enriches error data based on the results retrieved from Censys. 

#### Transformation: Error Enrichment
- **Purpose**: To transform incoming error data by adding detailed enrichment information.
- **Type**: Transformation
- **Steps**:
  - **On Success**: Proceed to the next steps as defined in the component.
  - **On Failure**: Handle errors as per the failure protocols defined in the component.
  - **On Complete**: Conclude the action and handle the result according to the next steps defined in the component.

### Process Flow Summary

1. **Start**: The component initiates when an IP-based search query is submitted.
2. **Transformation**: The error data retrieved is processed to enrich it with specific details about the host.
   - The data includes fields such as enrichment type (e.g., reputation), provider details, and a verdict on the error (e.g., error or success).
   - This step ensures that the user is equipped with all relevant data pertaining to the IP address in question.
3. **Result Handling**: Depending on the success or failure of the enrichment process, subsequent actions or failure handling mechanisms are triggered.
4. **End**: The final result, which is the enriched data about the IP-based search, is either passed on to another system or presented to the user.

This component is crucial for enhancing the information security posture by automating the retrieval and enrichment of host data based on IP searches.
