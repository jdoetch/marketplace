Summary of the Component
The component takes a provided host identifier and prepares variables for use in subsequent actions. It extracts a single host ID and then enters a conditional parallel stage. Within this stage, it validates the input and, if valid, retrieves host information using a connector action. If any validation or retrieval step fails, it records an error. Finally, it collects the resulting host information or errors and updates a result variable for the end user to review.

Detailed Description of Each Action
Create_Variables  
Type: createVariables  
Purpose: Initializes variables, including the host_id array, result object, and ActionError object.  
On success: Moves to Get_Host_Id.  
On failure: Not defined.  
On complete: Not defined.

Get_Host_Id  
Type: transformation  
Purpose: Extracts the first host_id from the provided array to be used downstream.  
On success: Moves to Conditional_Parallel.  
On failure: Not defined.  
On complete: Not defined.

Conditional_Parallel  
Type: parallelGroup  
Purpose: Executes multiple actions in parallel. It validates the input against expected conditions and, if valid, proceeds to get host information. If invalid, it raises and records an error.  
On success: Moves to Get_Results.  
On failure: Not defined.  
On complete: Not defined.

Within Conditional_Parallel, the following actions are defined:

Input_Validation  
Type: conditional  
Purpose: Checks that the extracted host_id meets the requirements of the downstream action.  
On success: Continues to the next actions in parallel.  
On failure: Reroutes to Input_Validation_Error.  
Else: Input_Validation_Error triggered if condition fails.

Input_Validation_Error  
Type: python  
Purpose: Raises a custom error when input validation fails.  
On success: Calls Input_Validation_Update_Action_Error.  
On failure: Not defined.  
On complete: Not defined.

Input_Validation_Update_Action_Error  
Type: updateVariables  
Purpose: Updates the ActionError variable with details from the Input_Validation_Error action.  
On success: No further action.  
On failure: Not defined.  
On complete: Not defined.

Get_Host_Info  
Type: connector  
Purpose: Calls the CrowdStrike Falcon host_info action using the validated host_id.  
On success: Calls Action_Error_Update.  
On failure: Calls errorRaise.  
On complete: Not defined.

Action_Error_Update  
Type: updateVariables  
Purpose: Updates the ActionError variable to indicate that the action has completed without a raised error.  
On success: No further action.  
On failure: Not defined.  
On complete: Not defined.

errorRaise  
Type: python  
Purpose: Raises an exception if an error condition is encountered while retrieving host info.  
On success: Calls Update_Action_Error.  
On failure: Not defined.  
On complete: Not defined.

Update_Action_Error  
Type: updateVariables  
Purpose: Updates the ActionError variable based on the error encountered.  
On success: No further action.  
On failure: Not defined.  
On complete: Not defined.

Get_Results  
Type: transformation  
Purpose: Retrieves and transforms the host_info result for presentation. If successful, it makes the host information available for storage.  
On success: Calls Update_Result_Variable.  
On failure: Not defined.  
On complete: Not defined.

Update_Result_Variable  
Type: updateVariables  
Purpose: Sets the final result variable to the host information returned by Get_Host_Info or to an error state if one occurred.  
On success: No further actions.  
On failure: Not defined.  
On complete: Not defined.

Overall Process Flow Summary
The component begins by creating the necessary variables from input data. It then extracts a single host identifier and proceeds to a parallel stage where it validates that host_id. If the validation fails, it records an appropriate error. If it passes, it attempts to retrieve host information from CrowdStrike Falcon.

If retrieval is successful, it updates the error variable to indicate completion and passes the results onward. If any step in the retrieval fails, it logs an error and updates the error tracking variable accordingly.

Finally, the component gathers the results of the actions, transforming them into a structured output. It updates the result variable so that the end user can review the host information or any errors that were encountered.

The component concludes with a final set of variables that clearly represent either the successful retrieval of host details or the recorded errors, enabling end users to understand the outcome of the componentâ€™s execution.
