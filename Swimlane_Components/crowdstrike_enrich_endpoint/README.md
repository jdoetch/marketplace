This component processes a host identifier, validates the input, retrieves host information from CrowdStrike, and updates variables with results or errors. It begins by setting up variables, extracting a host identifier, then checking conditions before proceeding with external calls. It manages both successful outcomes and error conditions, ensuring that any encountered errors are recorded and available for review.
