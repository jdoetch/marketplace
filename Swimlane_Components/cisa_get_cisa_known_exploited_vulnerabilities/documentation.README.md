The CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog is a resource maintained by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) that lists vulnerabilities actively exploited in the wild.


Prioritize Remediation:

- Focus on vulnerabilities listed in the KEV catalog since they are confirmed to be actively exploited.

- These should take precedence over other vulnerabilities in your environment as they pose immediate risk.

Usage:
- Install the component

- Enrich your CVE data by cross-referencing it with the CISA KEV catalog. This helps SOC analysts prioritize remediation efforts by focusing on vulnerabilities actively exploited in the wild.
