The CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog is a resource maintained by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) that lists vulnerabilities actively exploited in the wild.


Prioritize Remediation:

- Focus on vulnerabilities listed in the KEV catalog since they are confirmed to be actively exploited.

- These should take precedence over other vulnerabilities in your environment as they pose immediate risk.
