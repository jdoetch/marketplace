# CloudFlare_ Get Account Audit Logs Component

## Overview
The CloudFlare_ Get Account Audit Logs component is designed to automate the retrieval of audit logs from a CloudFlare account. This component ensures that users can systematically access log data concerning actions performed within their CloudFlare account, facilitating a meticulous approach to security and compliance.

## Component Summary
This component primarily revolves around the `Get Audit Logs` action. This action executes an HTTP request to CloudFlare's API to fetch the account audit logs between specified dates. This component is capable of functioning under scenarios where detailed audit trail records are required for security auditing, operational monitoring, or compliance verification.
