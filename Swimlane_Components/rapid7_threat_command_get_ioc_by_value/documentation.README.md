# Documentation for Rapid7 Threat Command - Get IOC by Value

## Overview
The Rapid7 Threat Command - Get IOC by Value is a specialized component designed to interact with threat intelligence to retrieve Indicators of Compromise (IOC) based on specific values. This document outlines the functionalities, processes, and actions embedded in this component, guiding users through its operational workflow and technical features.

## Short Description
This component exists to provide real-time data retrieval from Rapid7's Threat Command intelligence sources. By specifying an IOC value, users can efficiently extract related threat details, which facilitates rapid decision-making and enhances security protocols.

## Process Flow Summary
1. **Action "Get by Value" Initialization**: The operation begins when the "Get by Value" action is triggered.
   - **Type**: Connector
   - **On-success**: Proceed to component result processing.
   - **On-failure**: Ends the operation with failure, doesn't proceed further unless specified.
   - **On-complete**: Moves to Component Result regardless of success or failure.

2. **Component Result Processing**: This transformation action takes over post "Get by Value" operation.
   - **Type**: Transformation
   - **Summary**: This step involves transforming the raw data received into a structured format that can be used for further processing or decision-making.

## Detailed Action Descriptions
### Get by Value
- **Purpose**: To fetch IOC data based on the provided value.
- **Inputs**:
  - **Parameters**: Receives the IOC value from the user or an automated input system.
  - **Headers** & **SSL Verification**: Ensures data transfer is secure and headers are customized if necessary.
- **Success Path**: If the fetch is successful, the result is passed on to the Component Result for further processing.
- **Failure Path**: On failure, the action typically ends unless specific failure handling measures are in place.

### Component Result
- **Purpose**: To transform and assimilate data in usable formats.
- **Outputs**:
  - **Data Structure**: Processes and converts the input data into designated formats.
  - **Error Checking**: Performs validation to check if data exists after executing the "Get by Value" action. 

## Conclusion
The component Rapid7 Threat Command - Get IOC by Value is designed to be an efficient and secure means of retrieving valuable threat intelligence data. Its structured process flow ensures robust data handling and transformation, facilitating better security practices.
